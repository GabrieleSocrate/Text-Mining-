Other Events Microsoft Corporation (the “Company”) is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to recast certain previously reported amounts to conform with segment reporting changes made to align our segments with how we manage our business, with respect to the financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 (“2024 Form 10-K”). In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects these segment changes. We provided a brief description of the segment changes in a Form 8-K filed on August 21, 2024. The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require that when a registrant prepares, on or after the date a registrant reports an accounting change such as the segment changes noted above, a new registration, proxy, or information statement (or amends a previously filed registration, proxy, or information statement) that includes or incorporates by reference financial statements, the registrant must recast the prior period financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the registration, proxy, or information statement to reflect these types of changes. Accordingly, the Company is filing this Form 8-K to recast our consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, to reflect the changes in segment reporting as described above. The updates do not represent a restatement of previously issued financial statements. The recast information of Items contained in the 2024 Form 10-K is presented in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. The information included in this Form 8-K is presented for informational purposes only in connection with the segment reporting changes described above and does not amend or restate our audited consolidated financial statements, which were included in our 2024 Form 10-K. This Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring after we filed our 2024 Form 10-K and does not modify or update the disclosures therein in any way, other than to illustrate the impact of the segment changes as described above. For developments subsequent to the filing of the 2024 Form 10-K, refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024."

The rule published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2025 at 90 Fed. Reg. 4544. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density. Unless one of the new license exceptions is available to specific transactions, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada. The IFR is subject to a notice and public comment period of 120 days from publication, i.e., by May 15, 2025. Unless the IFR is modified, in whole or in part, or withdrawn altogether by the incoming Trump Administration, exporters, reexports, and transferors are required to begin compliance with the IFR’s licensing, reporting, and other requirements on May 15, 2025. The Company supports U.S. leadership in innovation by providing cutting-edge solutions, working to make American advancements a global standard, and constantly pursuing rapid progress. The Company supports creating new datacenters in the United States and promotes efforts to develop the necessary infrastructure. The Company also supports the safe and responsible development and deployment of all AI-powered systems and will provide feedback on the IFR during the notice and comment period. The “Additional Due Diligence Measures” Rule On January 16, 2025, the Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, published a rule entitled “Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits.” The rule is intended to reduce the diversion of ICs to unauthorized end uses or end users that meet the control parameters of ECCN 3A090 by end users who misrepresent the performance capabilities of their ICs to the foundries that manufacture them or the companies that assemble the ICs, or OSATs, into packages. The rule requires additional diligence for foundries and OSATs to verify technical parameters, although approved IC designers are considered a reliable source to verify technical parameters of the applicable advanced logic ICs. NVIDIA Corporation is an approved IC designer and thus the rule is not expected to have an impact on our operations or on product sales to China. Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K including statements regarding the scope of the licensing requirement under the IFR; NVIDIA’s products that are subject to the IFR; the impact of the IFR on NVIDIA’s future products; the effectiveness and effective date of the IFR; NVIDIA providing feedback on the IFR during the notice and comment period; and the “Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits” rule unexpected to have an impact on NVIDIA’s operations or on product sales to China are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; NVIDIA’s reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test NVIDIA’s products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to NVIDIA’s existing product and technologies; market acceptance of NVIDIA’s products or its partners’ products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of NVIDIA’s products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the most recent reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

As previously disclosed, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the ""Company"") maintains a Bonus Plan (the ""Bonus Plan"") that provides variable cash incentives, payable annually, which are designed to motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements. Payouts under the Bonus Plan are calculated by multiplying (a) each executive officer's base eligible earnings times his or her target bonus percentage and (b) the company performance percentage approved by the Compensation, Nominating & Governance Committee (the ""CNGC"") of the Company's Board of Directors for the relevant annual performance period. On February 13, 2025, the CNGC approved an increase in the target bonus percentage under the Bonus Plan for each of the Company's named executive officers (other than its Chief Executive Officer (the ""CEO"")) from 75% of each such named executive officer's base salary to 200% of each named executive officer's base salary, effective beginning with the 2025 annual performance period under the Bonus Plan. The CNGC analyzes market data for executive compensation at least annually, including based on input from its independent compensation consultant. In approving this increase, the CNGC considered that the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions at the peer group of companies that the Company benchmarks against for executive compensation purposes (the ""Peer Group Target Cash Compensation""). Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation."

The Audit & Finance Committee (the ""Audit Committee"") of the board of directors (the “Board”) of Intel, in connection with the Company's management team, has approved an enterprise-wide initiative started in second quarter of 2025 to fundamentally transform our culture and the way in which we operate, which is designed to simplify the way we do business and drive transparency and accountability across the company which was communicated to employees on July 24, 2025. The Audit Committee approved the initiative on July 10, 2025. As part of this transformation, we implemented the 2025 Restructuring Plan to lower expenses, streamline our organizational structure and reduce management layers across functions while reallocating resources toward our core client and server businesses by reducing investment in lower-priority programs and initiatives. The Company expects these headcount reduction initiatives will reduce our core Intel workforce by 15% by the end of fiscal 2025. As a result of initiating and deploying the 2025 Restructuring Plan, the Company expects to recognize $1.9 billion of restructuring charges related to these actions, of which the Company is recognizing $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2025. The restructuring actions, which are expected to be substantially complete by the fourth quarter of 2025 are primarily comprised of the following: ▪ Headcount reductions: The Company is recognizing pre-tax employee severance and related employee exit charges of $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2025, the substantial majority of which will be cash settled in future periods. ▪ Business Exits and Real Estate Consolidations: The Company is recognizing non-cash asset impairment charges of $416 million in the second quarter of 2025, resulting from the exit of certain non-core lines of business and the consolidation and exit of certain real estate properties. * * * * * This Item 2.05 contains forward-looking statements with respect to the Company's cost and capital reduction initiatives, including with respect to the timing and amount of future cash expenditures.

Appointment of Chief Executive Officer On March 10, 2025, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Intel Corporation (“Intel” or the “Company”) appointed Lip-Bu Tan as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and as a director of the Company, effective as of March 18, 2025 (the “Effective Date”). Mr. Tan, age 65, previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Cadence Design Systems, a computational software company, from 2009 to December 2021, and as Executive Board Chair at Cadence from December 2021 to May 2023. Mr. Tan was previously a director of Intel from September 2022 until August 2024. Mr. Tan is the chairman of Walden International, an international venture capital firm he founded in 1987, and the founding managing partner of two other funds, Celesta Capital and Walden Catalyst Ventures. Mr. Tan also serves as chairman of the board of directors of Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. (Nasdaq: CRDO), a connectivity solutions provider, and is on the board of directors of Schneider Electric SE (OTCMKTS: SBGSY; Euronext Paris: SU), a digital automation and energy management company. Mr. Tan previously served on the board of directors of SoftBank (TYO: 9984; OTCMKTS: SFBQF) from June 2020 to June 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) from October 2015 to April 2021, and HiDeep Inc. (KOSDAQ:365590) from May 2012 to August 2022. Mr. Tan is an advisory board member of University of California, Berkeley’s College of Engineering and Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, and a 2022 recipient of the Robert N. Noyce Award from the Semiconductor Industry Association. Mr. Tan brings deep semiconductor industry, emerging technologies, finance, investment, M&A and public company leadership expertise from his various CEO and director roles. In connection with Mr. Tan’s appointment as CEO, the Company entered into an offer letter with Mr. Tan (the “Offer Letter”) setting forth the terms of his employment and compensation. Pursuant to the Offer Letter, Mr. Tan will be an at-will employee entitled to an initial base salary of $1,000,000 and eligible for an annual incentive cash bonus with a target payout of 200% of his base salary under Intel’s Executive Annual Performance Bonus Plan. The Offer Letter also provides that Mr. Tan will be granted the following long-term incentive equity awards and new hire equity awards as soon as practicable following his employment start date: 2025 Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards • Performance stock units based on relative total shareholder return metrics (“TSR PSUs”), with a target number of Intel shares subject to the grant having a target valuation of $14,400,000, as determined by Intel using the simple average of Intel’s trading prices over a 30-day period preceding March 12, 2025 (the “Conversion Price”). Vesting of such TSR PSUs will be based on Intel’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period. • Nonqualified stock options (“Options”) with a number of Intel shares subject to the grant having a grant date value of $9,600,000, determined by Intel using the Conversion Price. The exercise price of the Options will be the average of the high and low sales price of Intel’s stock on the grant date. The Options will vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period. New Hire Equity Awards • Performance-based stock options based on relative total shareholder return metrics (“New Hire Options”), with a target number of Intel shares subject to the grant having a grant date value of $25,000,000, determined by Intel using the Conversion Price. The exercise price of the New Hire Options will be the average of the high and low sales price of Intel’s stock on the grant date. One-fifth of the New Hire Options will vest per year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and continuing each year such that the grant is fully vested on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. For the first two vesting dates, the New Hire Options will vest at target, after which, vesting of the New Hire Options will be based on Intel’s TSR relative to the TSR of the S&P 500 Index in the third, fourth, and fifth years following the date of grant. • Performance stock units (“New Hire PSUs”) based on the appreciation in Intel’s closing stock price over the three-year period following the grant date, with a target number of Intel shares subject to the grant having a target valuation of $17,000,000, determined by Intel using the Conversion Price. No shares will be earned under the New Hire PSUs unless Intel's stock price increases over Intel’s volume-weighted average closing stock price for the 30 consecutive trading days preceding March 12, 2025 (the “VWAP”). The target number of shares under the New Hire PSUs will be earned if Intel’s closing stock price is 200% of the VWAP. The maximum number of shares under the New Hire PSUs (or 300% of the target number of shares) will be earned if Intel’s stock price is 300% of the VWAP. The number of New Hire PSUs that will be earned in the event of an increase in Intel’s stock price between the levels of achievement will be determined via straight line interpolation of the earned percentages. Fifty percent of the New Hire PSUs will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and twenty-five percent will vest on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Mr. Tan holding through each such vesting date the $25,000,000 in Intel shares he purchased, as detailed below; provided that, Intel’s TSR must be at least in the 55 th percentile in relation to the TSR of the S&P 500 Index for such three-year period for any amount of New Hire PSUs in excess of the target number of PSUs to vest. • Mr. Tan also agrees to purchase Intel shares from Intel within 30 days following his employment start date having a target valuation of $25,000,000. The Offer Letter also provides that in the event Mr. Tan’s employment is terminated by Intel without Cause (as defined in the Offer Letter), and he signs and does not revoke a release, Mr. Tan will receive pro rata vesting on each of the above equity grants, determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to such award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of full months elapsed from the most recent vesting date to the date Mr. Tan’s employment terminates without Cause, and the denominator of which is the total number of months remaining in the applicable vesting schedule, with the number shares subject to performance-based awards vesting based on the greater of target and actual performance for periods in which performance has not yet been determined. Following such pro-rata vesting, the Options and New Hire Options will remain exercisable for a period of 18 months. In the event Mr. Tan’s employment is terminated by Intel without Cause or for Good Reason (as defined in the Offer Letter) following a Change in Control (as defined in the Offer Letter), and Mr. Tan signs and does not revoke a release, then each of the equity grants provided to Mr. Tan under the Offer Letter will receive accelerated vesting (i) with respect to 67% of outstanding and unvested shares subject to such award if such Change in Control and termination occurs within 18 months of his employment start date and (ii) with respect to 100% of outstanding and unvested shares subject to such award if such Change in Control and termination occurs after such 18-month period. Following such accelerated vesting, the Options and New Hire Options will remain exercisable for a period of 18 months following the date of termination, subject to the terms of the transaction agreement governing the treatment of the Options and New Hire Options in connection with the transaction constituting a Change in Control. The foregoing description of Mr. Tan’s Offer Letter and compensation arrangements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Offer Letter, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Mr. Tan does not have any family relationship with any director or executive officer of Intel, or person nominated or chosen by Intel to become a director or executive officer, and he has no direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

In connection with the execution of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and Limited Liability Company Agreement, the parties will enter into certain ancillary agreements which generally provide Intel or Intel Ireland, as applicable, with rights and obligations with respect to the construction, commissioning, operation, management, maintenance, utilization and purchase of wafers produced in Fab 34 consistent with their ordinary course practices with respect to such matters but subject to agreed minimum wafer fab performance standards and minimum wafer purchase obligations by Intel. Intel Ireland will retain full ownership of Fab 34 and any and all intellectual property rights arising from, relating to or in connection with the activities of and services to JV Company. Specifically, these ancillary agreements provide that: • JV Company will acquire from Intel Ireland rights to cause and direct the operation of Intel Ireland’s Fab 34 facility, allowing JV Company to direct the manufacture of wafers from Fab 34 for the benefit of JV Company; • JV Company will engage Intel Ireland to operate and maintain Fab 34, with Intel Ireland agreeing to minimum performance standards including with respect to production, availability, and yield, and to provide administrative services to JV Company; • Intel Ireland agrees with JV Company and Co-Investor to complete the construction and commission of Fab 34, including the achievement of certain timing and capacity milestones, with substantial completion of Fab 34 targeted for June 2026; • JV Company and Intel Ireland will allocate risk of loss and set out insurance matters relating to Fab 34 whereby JV Company will bear the risk of certain portions of certain categories of losses; • Intel agrees to purchase wafers from JV Company for itself and/or for marketing and sale to third-party customers, with Intel agreeing to minimum volume commitments for its demand for wafers, preferential loading of Fab 34 relative to other Intel fabs running the same process and tooling, and pricing of wafers at manufacturing cost plus an agreed upon margin, and the payment of liquidated damages in various circumstances if Intel fails to meet its minimum volume commitments; and • Intel provides a parent guarantee with respect to the obligations of Intel Ireland. Under the various ancillary agreements, Intel or Intel Ireland may be required to pay liquidated damages or termination payments under a variety of underperformance, breach, termination or other scenarios in such amounts as to enable JV Company to distribute in respect of Co-Investor's units an amount up to 140% of the Purchase Price.

On April 25, 2024, Intel Corporation (“Intel”) issued a press release announcing the financial results of its first quarter ended March 30, 2024 and forward-looking statements relating to its second quarter of 2024. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. The attached press release includes non-GAAP financial measures relating to our operations and forecasted outlook. Certain of these non-GAAP measures will be used in Intel’s earnings conference for the first quarter of 2024. In addition, the attached press release includes reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, as well as an explanation of how management uses these non-GAAP measures and the reasons why management views these measures as providing useful information for investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to these results should be carefully evaluated.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosu r e. Intel Corporation (the ""Company"") previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for third party customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to third party customers. Both businesses utilize marketing, sales, and other support functions. Our internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate Altera, an Intel company (previously Intel's Programmable Solutions Group), as a standalone business, with segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in our DCAI segment results. As a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for 2023 or any other periods. On April 2, 2024 we furnished as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K a retrospective revision to Item 7 of Intel Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for the year-ended December 30, 2023 (the ""Retrospective Revision"").

Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) Bonuses for Fiscal 2025 On February 10, 2026, the Compensation and Leadership Resources Committee (the “ Committee ”) of the Board of Directors (the “ Board ”) of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Su, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer $3,125,430 These bonus awards are expected to be paid in March 2026. CEO Value Creation Equity Award On February 11, 2026, the Committee recommended, and the Board approved the grant of a special long-term equity incentive award to Dr. Su, with a target value of $75 million for Dr. Su (the “ CEO Value Creation Equity Award ”). The CEO Value Creation Equity Award will be granted on March 15, 2026 (the "" Grant Date ""), under the terms of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “ Plan ”). The CEO Value Creation Award is made in recognition of Dr. Su’s unique value and the criticality of her contributions to the Company’s strategic plans, to motivate and reward creation of exceptional shareholder value, and to further incentivize her long-term retention and dedication. The Award will be converted into a target number of performance-based restricted stock units (“ PRSUs ”) determined by dividing the Award’s target value by the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 30 trading-day period ending on the Grant Date (the “ Conversion Price ”). The number of PRSUs that may be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the target number of PRSUs based on achievement of stock price hurdles during the performance period that begins on the Grant Date and ends on March 15, 2031 (or, if earlier, the date of a change of control or Dr. Su’s death or disability) (each as defined in the Plan)) (the “ Performance Period ”). Each earned PRSU represents the unfunded contractual right to receive one share of Company common stock upon vesting. The Board and Compensation Committee designed the Award to strongly align Dr. Su’s pay opportunities with our long-term strategic plan and shareholders’ interests. The Award is 100% performance-based, tied to four stock price hurdles that are each substantially above the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 60 trading-day period ending on the Grant Date (the "" Baseline Price ""). Each of the four tranches vests if, and only if, the Company’s 90-trading day average closing stock price meets or exceeds each hurdle during the Performance Period, subject to Dr. Su’s continued employment or service. Percentage of target # of PRSUs earned Stock price hurdle (5-Year CAGR % or $) (1) Threshold 0% Less than 10% Tranche 1 50% 10% Tranche 2 100% 15% Tranche 3 150% 17.5% Tranche 4 200% $600 ____________ (1) The stock price hurdles shown as percentages will be calculated based on the price per share that would result if the price increased from the Baseline Price to the price necessary to achieve a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) equal to such stated percentage. Final stock price hurdle for Tranche 1, Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 will be calculated on the Grant Date and rounded to the nearest $5.00. In determining the stock price hurdles, the Committee considered the Company’s all-time stock price high as of the Grant Date of $267.08, as well as the most recent five-year stock price CAGRs of both the S&P 500 and its current Information Technology constituents, and set the target hurdle price well above the 50 th percentile of the most recent five-year CAGR observed for both groups. Notwithstanding the date of hurdle achievement, any PRSUs that are earned on or before the third anniversary of the grant date will not vest until the third anniversary of the Grant Date, at which point 50% of such earned PRSUs will vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date, with the remaining 50% vesting on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date. Any PRSUs that are earned after the third anniversary of the Grant Date but before or on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date will vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date. For any earned PRSUs to vest, Dr. Su must remain in service as the Company’s CEO or Executive Chair of the Board through the applicable vesting date. The extended vesting structure of the Award means that she will realize the full actual Award value only if she remains with the Company for the entire Performance Period (except in the case of death or disability or the limited termination scenarios outlined below). This design promotes long-term alignment with shareholders and with the Company’s leadership continuity and retention objectives. If Dr. Su is terminated for cause, all unvested and unearned PRSUs are forfeited. If she incurs a “covered termination” (as defined in her employment agreement), then (a) the unvested earned PRSUs that were scheduled to vest on or before the one-year anniversary of her termination date will immediately vest and (b) the unvested or unearned PRSUs will remain outstanding for 12 months (or, if earlier, until March 15, 2031 or the date of a change in control (as defined in the Plan)) and vest if such PRSUs would have vested had she remained employed in a covered position for such period. Following a deliberative process, the Board and the Committee determined that the Award best served the Company’s motivation and retention objectives aligning with our long-term strategic plan and the interests of our shareholders. Dr. Su is the principal architect of our strategic plan. The Board believes that Dr. Su’s continued focus and strategic vision are critical to the successful execution of this shift. Accordingly, the Award directly ties her pay opportunities to our success, but only if (x) she remains in a full-time leadership role with the Company throughout the Performance Period and (y) successfully executes our strategies in a manner that drives market outperformance and sustained shareholder value creation. The Award is not part of Dr. Su’s regular annual compensation. The Board intends that the Award be a one-time special equity award and that, absent extraordinary or unforeseen circumstances, she will not receive any other special equity award (i.e., an equity award outside of her regular annual compensation) for the duration of the Performance Period. The foregoing description of the CEO Value Creation Award does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the CEO Value Creation Award agreement."

Each PRSU represents the contractual right to receive, upon such PRSU becoming earned and vested, one share of Company common stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company's TSR over the Performance Period is negative, then the total number of PRSUs (if any) earned by the recipient pursuant to this clause (a) may not exceed 100% of the recipient’s target number of PRSUs. The TSR will be measured based on the average closing sales price of the Company's and each Peer Company's stock for the 60-trading-day period ending on (and including) each of (x) August 15, 2025, and (y) the last day or the Performance Period, accounting for reinvestment of dividends. (b) The recipient will earn an additional number of PRSUs equal to 0%, 25% or 50% of the number of PRSUs (if any) earned by such named executive officer under clause (a), above, depending on the Company’s non-GAAP earnings per share (“ EPS ”) for fiscal 2027 as compared to the Company’s target fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS. If a change of control occurs before the Company reports its fiscal 2027 earnings, but after the Company reports its fiscal 2026 earnings, the recipient will earn 0%, 25%, or 50% of the number of PRSUs (if any) earned by the recipient under clause (a), above, based on the percentage by which the Company’s fiscal 2026 non-GAAP EPS exceeds its fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS. If a change of control occurs before the Company reports its fiscal 2026 earnings, no additional PRSUs will be earned by the recipient under this clause (b). Vesting of any earned PRSUs is generally subject to the recipient’s continued employment with the Company through August 15, 2028. Earned and vested PRSUs will generally be settled on August 22, 2028 or, if later, the date that is three business days following the Committee’s certification of performance. In the event of a change in control, the number of earned PRSUs will be determined by the Committee based on actual performance as of the date of the change in control and such number of earned PRSUs will convert automatically into RSUs that will generally vest and be settled upon the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the change in control or August 15, 2028. Stock Options . The Stock Options will have an exercise price equal to 100% of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Grant Date, and will vest 1/4 on August 15, 2026 and then quarterly thereafter until August 15, 2029.

Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition, or otherwise, based on current beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur.

As of March 31, 2025, there are no borrowings outstanding under the ZT Credit Agreement. The facility is available to be used for all lawful and permitted purposes. The obligations under the ZT Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of ZT pursuant to a collateral agreement entered into with the collateral agent, subject to certain customary exceptions including intellectual property.

For Ms. Hu and Messrs. Guido and Norrod, their respective Target Values will be converted on the Grant Date into a mix of 60% PRSUs, 20% Stock Options and 20% time-based restricted stock units (“ RSUs ”). For each recipient, the target number of PRSUs will be determined by dividing the allocable portion of the recipient’s Target Value by the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the 30 trading-day average period ending on the Grant Date (the “ Conversion Price ”). If applicable, the number of Stock Options will be determined by dividing the allocable portion of the recipient’s Target Value using the Conversion Price and a stock option valuation factor determined in accordance with the Company’s equity valuation practices, and, if applicable, the number of RSUs will be determined by dividing the allocable portion of the recipient’s Target Value by the Conversion Price. PRSUs . The number of PRSUs that may be earned by a recipient will range from 0% to 250% of the recipient’s target number of PRSUs. Each PRSU represents the contractual right to receive, upon such PRSU becoming earned and vested, one share of Company common stock. Subject to the foregoing award limits, the actual number of PRSUs earned will be calculated as follows: (a) The recipient will earn between 0% and 200% of the recipient’s target number of PRSUs depending on the return on the Company’s stock price relative to the return on the S&P 500 Index, in each case over the performance period that begins on August 9, 2024 and ends on August 9, 2027 (or, if earlier, the date immediately preceding the effective date of a change of control (as defined in the 2023 Plan)) (as applicable, the “ Performance Period ”); provided, however, that if the return on the Company’s stock price over the Performance Period is negative, then the total number of PRSUs (if any) earned by the recipient pursuant to this clause (a) may not exceed 100% of the recipient’s target number of PRSUs. (b) The recipient will earn an additional number of PRSUs equal to 0%, 25% or 50% of the number of PRSUs (if any) earned by such named executive officer under clause (a), above, depending on the Company’s non-GAAP earnings per share (“ EPS ”) for fiscal 2026 as compared to the Company’s fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS. If a change of control occurs before the Company reports its fiscal 2026 earnings, but after the Company reports its fiscal 2025 earnings, the recipient will earn 0%, 25%, or 50% of the number of PRSUs (if any) earned by the recipient under clause (a), above, based on the percentage by which the Company’s fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS exceeds its fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS. If a change of control occurs before the Company reports its fiscal 2025 earnings, no additional PRSUs will be earned by the recipient under this clause (b). Vesting of any earned PRSUs is generally subject to the recipient’s continued employment with the Company through August 9, 2027. Earned and vested PRSUs will generally be settled on August 15, 2027 or, if later, the date that is three business days following the Committee’s certification of performance. In the event of a change in control, the number of earned PRSUs will be determined by the Committee based on actual performance as of the date of the change in control and such number of earned PRSUs will convert automatically into RSUs that will generally vest and be settled upon the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the change in control or August 15, 2027. Stock Options . The Stock Options will have an exercise price equal to 100% of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Grant Date, and will vest 1/4 on each of August 9, 2025, August 9, 2026, August 9, 2027 and August 9, 2028. The Stock Options will have a term of seven years. RSUs . The RSUs granted to Ms. Hu and Messrs. Guido and Norrod will vest 1/4 on each of August 9, 2025, August 9, 2026 and August 9, 2027 and August 9, 2028.

The Credit Agreement replaces the Credit Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2020 (as amended, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders and letter of credit issuers party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, which provided for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on December 23, 2025 and become current on December 23, 2024.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Firm”) announced that the independent members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the annual compensation for 2025 for Mr. James Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $43,000,000 compared to last year’s annual compensation of $39,000,000. The annual compensation for 2025 reflects Mr. Dimon’s stewardship of the Firm, with strong performance across our market-leading businesses and financial results, as well as a fortress balance sheet, and continues to demonstrate strong pay-for-performance alignment. Mr. Dimon’s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and performance-based variable incentive compensation of $41,500,000. $5,000,000 of the variable incentive compensation will be delivered in cash and the remaining $36,500,000 will be delivered in the form of at-risk Performance Share Units (""PSUs""). PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Dimon’s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics, representing 88% of his total variable incentive compensation. This significant weighting of pay mix to equity is designed to align with shareholders’ interests by encouraging continued focus on the long-term success of the Firm. The key features of the PSU program are consistent with last year, including the financial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - ""ROTCE"") with absolute and relative performance goals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as well as clawback and recovery provisions. 2 Under Mr. Dimon's stewardship in 2025, the Firm delivered strong results and maintained its fortress balance sheet principles. Results reflect execution on long-term strategic initiatives, years of investment, a favorable market backdrop, and selective deployment of excess capital. In 2025, the Firm reported record revenue for the eighth-consecutive year of $185.6 billion 1 and net income of $57.0 billion, or $20.02 per share, with ROTCE of 20% representing sustained strong relative outperformance compared to peers. The Firm increased its quarterly common dividend from $1.25 to $1.50 per share. The Firm ended 2025 with a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio 3 of 14.5%, CET1 capital 3 of $288 billion and $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities 4 , providing it with meaningful capacity to support clients and further invest in its business and communities. During 2025, the Firm raised approximately $3.3 trillion of credit and capital 5 for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which include individuals, homeowners, small and large-sized businesses, schools, hospitals, cities, states, and countries. The Firm continued its investments in data, technology, and AI research and capabilities; people and products; and corporate responsibility, positioning the Firm for future success. Lastly, the Firm opened its new global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue in New York, one of many investments to create collaborative work environments for employees, serve clients locally and globally, and contribute to local economies. The Board evaluated Mr. Dimon’s holistic performance across financial and non-financial results, as well as the competitive environment, in determining his compensation. As part of their evaluation and determination, the Board considered Mr. Dimon’s continued development of top executives to lead for today and the future, his continued commitment to shareholders and his longstanding exemplary leadership of a premier financial services firm. 1 Revenue is on a managed basis. Managed revenue and ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures.

In addition, all equity awards granted in 2026 contain recapture provisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the value of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances.

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Registrant” or the “firm”) today announced that the Board of Directors (“Board”), upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, has determined 2025 total annual compensation for David Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of $47 million. This compares to total annual compensation for 2024 of $39 million. The components of total annual compensation are as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Annual Variable Compensation Amount / % at grant allocated to: Base Salary* PSUs** CIP*** Cash David Solomon $2.0 $31.5 (70%) $3.4 (7.5%) $10.1 (22.5%) * Annual base salary unchanged year-over-year. ** Equity amount at grant. PSUs tie 100% of equity-based compensation to ongoing firmwide performance metrics; PSU design is unchanged year-over-year. *** Allocation to carry points pursuant to the terms of the Carried Interest Program (CIP), tying a portion of what would have otherwise been cash compensation to the long-term performance of a strategic growth area for the firm. The Compensation Committee was guided in its determination of 2025 compensation by, among other things, the firm’s Assessment Framework, which is comprised of identified firmwide financial performance metrics as well as non-financial factors (i.e., strategic priorities and client orientation, risk management and controls, and people and culture). In making its determination, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things: • Continued and significant shareholder value creation during 2025, including a total shareholder return of 57%, a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend and 6.2% book value per share growth as well as nearly $17 billion of capital returned to common shareholders, • Strong firmwide financial performance, with second highest net revenues and net earnings, a 27% increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS) and a 230 basis point improvement in return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE), • Continued strong momentum in executing on our strategic priorities to grow and strengthen the firm, while also meaningfully improving the risk profile of the firm and enhancing the resilience of our earnings since our first Investor Day, • Strong performance in support of our clients across Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management — our world-class interconnected franchises, • Enduring and relentless focus on our culture and Core Values, with client centricity and our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos serving as foundational drivers of long-term value creation, • Ongoing emphasis on the importance of investing in and maintaining a strong risk management and control environment to support our business activities, and • Continued advancement of our people strategy, taking into account the ongoing competitive threat to our best talent from both traditional banking peers as well as alternative asset managers and other non-bank liquidity providers. The Committee also considered the firm’s financial performance, both on an absolute basis and relative to peer results as well as in the context of the 2025 operating environment and longer-term results. For the year ended December 31, 2025, the firm reported full-year net revenues of $58.28 billion, net earnings of $17.18 billion, diluted EPS of $51.32 and ROE of 15.0%."

In determining this total compensation, the independent members of the Board recognized Mr. Moynihan’s leadership in driving growth for shareholders, and supporting communities and employees in 2025. This included: • Earnings growth, as net income rose 13% to $30.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share rose 19% to $3.81. • Revenue growth, which was up 7% to $113.1 billion. This reflected record net interest income, up 7%, which was complemented by the sustained performance of the Company’s markets-facing businesses of sales and trading, 7% growth in investment banking fees and 12% growth in asset management fees. • Disciplined expense management, which included increased investments in people, technology, marketing and the Company’s physical and digital delivery networks. A continued focus on operational excellence helped generate approximately 250 bps of operating leverage and a 147 bps improvement in the Company’s efficiency ratio to 62%. • Balance sheet strength and effectiveness, with total assets of $3.4 trillion, including $201 billion of CET1 capital and $975 billion of average global liquidity sources. • A lower net charge-off ratio and stability in other asset quality metrics, while supporting client needs and broader economic growth, with ending loans up 8% and ending deposits up 3%. • Shareholder returns, with return on assets (“ROA”) of 0.89%, a 7 bps improvement, and return on average common shareholders’ equity of 10.6%, a 106 bps improvement. • Market performance, following a 31% increase in the Company’s stock price in 2024, the stock rose another 25% in 2025, and reached a new, all-time high during 2025. Market capitalization increased 19% from December 31, 2024. As a result, the Company maintained its position as the second-largest U.S. bank by market capitalization. • The success of investments in making the Company a Great Place to Work, evidenced in the Employee Engagement Index which was 86% favorable and stable employee turnover of 8%. This year, the Company raised the minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. teammates to $25/hour reaching its goal to achieve $25/hour by 2025. The Company also recently announced the ninth year of Sharing Success awards, with ~96% of employees receiving an award, aligning their interests with those of shareholders. • The Company’s impact on local communities through more than $289 million in philanthropic investments and more than 2.5 million employee volunteer hours. *Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates are for full year 2025 compared to full year 2024. Mr. Moynihan’s compensation is composed of base salary and equity incentive consisting of time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance RSUs. Mr. Moynihan’s annual base salary remains unchanged at $1.5 million and consistent with prior years, there is no cash bonus. The aggregate value of his 2025 equity incentive awarded by the Board is $39.5 million which is comprised 30% of cash-settled RSUs that will vest over the next 12 months, 20% of stock-settled RSUs that will vest annually over the next four years, and 50% of stock-settled performance RSUs. All of Mr. Moynihan’s 2025 equity incentive awards are subject to the Company’s stock ownership and retention requirements, and the Company’s cancellation and clawback policies. The performance RSUs, while awarded for 2025 performance, must be re-earned based on the Company’s future financial performance from 2026-2028. For this award, the Board increased the performance standards necessary to re-earn 100% payout and also provided the opportunity to earn up to 150% maximum payout for exceptional future performance, as described in the table below. The increased performance standards and introduction of upside payout opportunity reflect the Company’s and Board’s focus on long-term responsible growth, as well as the alignment of pay with the successful achievement of growth for shareholders. Under a hypothetical scenario, if the Company’s 2025 full-year average assets of $3.4 trillion remained constant during the performance period, the Company would need to earn $92 billion in aggregate net income from 2026-2028 to achieve the 90bps ROA standard in order to earn a 100% target payout. The Company would need to earn $112 billion in aggregate net income from 2026-2028 to achieve the 110bps ROA standard in order to earn a 150% maximum payout. On an annualized basis, this equals approximately $31 billion in earnings to earn a 100% target payout and $37 billion to earn the 150% maximum payout, the latter of which is higher than any reported net income in the Company’s history. Performance Standard Target (100% Payout) Maximum (150% Payout) 3-year average growth of adjusted tangible book value 10.5% 12.5% 3-year average return on assets 90bps 110bps"

Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) has elected to change its accounting methods related to its tax-related affordable housing, eligible wind renewable energy and solar renewable energy equity investments. The Corporation determined that the new accounting methods are preferable as they better align the financial statement presentation with the economic impact of these equity investments. For its affordable housing and eligible wind renewable energy equity investments, the Corporation is changing its accounting from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method (PAM). Under PAM, the cost of the equity investments is amortized in proportion to the related income tax benefits and classified in income tax expense, whereas previously the cost of the equity investments was determined using the equity method of accounting and classified in noninterest income – other income. For its solar renewable energy equity investments, the Corporation is changing its accounting for the investment tax credits (ITCs) where the ITCs and applicable equity investment expense are recognized over the productive life of the underlying facilities, whereas previously the ITCs and applicable expense were recognized when the facilities were placed in service. As part of this accounting change, the Corporation is also electing to report the ITCs in noninterest income – other income against the related equity investment expense. The primary impact of the accounting changes described above is a reclassification between income statement line items. Following is a summary of the reclassifications between certain income statement lines to implement the accounting change: Year Ended Third Second First Fourth Third Second First December 31 Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter (in millions) 2024 2023 2025 2025 2025 2024 2024 2024 2024 Impact to total revenue, net of interest expense: Noninterest income - as previously reported $ 45,827 $ 41,650 $ 12,855 $ 11,793 $ 12,923 $ 10,988 $ 11,378 $ 11,675 $ 11,786 Adjustment 3,969 4,188 952 980 881 1,128 868 928 1,045 Noninterest income - revised $ 49,796 $ 45,838 $ 13,807 $ 12,773 $ 13,804 $ 12,116 $ 12,246 $ 12,603 $ 12,831 Impact to income tax expense: Income tax expense - as previously reported $ 2,122 $ 1,827 $ 987 $ 572 $ 720 $ 443 $ 428 $ 663 $ 588 Adjustment 4,128 4,398 1,089 926 917 987 1,053 1,022 1,066 Income tax expense - revised $ 6,250 $ 6,225 $ 2,076 $ 1,498 $ 1,637 $ 1,430 $ 1,481 $ 1,685 $ 1,654 In addition, the accounting changes have an insignificant impact on net income on an annualized basis, which were applied retrospectively through cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. As a result, retained earnings as of September 30, 2025 decreased $1.7 billion from the previously reported amount, reflecting the cumulative impact of the timing difference in expense recognition under the new accounting methods. This timing difference is expected to reverse over the remaining life of the investments. Under the applicable bank regulatory rules, the Corporation is not required to and, accordingly, will not revise previously filed regulatory capital ratios. However, the cumulative impact of the changes in accounting methods would have resulted in an estimated $2.1 billion decrease in the Corporation’s Common equity tier 1 capital due to the above-referenced impact to retained earnings as well as deferred tax effects, which would have resulted in a decrease of 13 basis points to the Common equity tier 1 ratio as of September 30, 2025. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 would have been an estimated 20.0% compared to 10.4% previously reported. The information contained in this Form 8-K has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the Corporation and is being furnished to assist investors in understanding how the changes in accounting methods, which are discussed above, affected the Corporation’s previously filed Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets. The information related to the changes in accounting methods is preliminary and based on company data available at the time this Form 8-K is furnished. Financial information presented in the Revised Supplemental Information for the prior quarters of 2025 and 2024, as well as the full years 2024 and 2023, has been updated to reflect the changes in accounting methods and is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

On February 13, 2026, Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) announced that Visa’s Board of Directors has authorized the Company to proceed with a successive exchange offer in respect of Visa’s outstanding Class B common stock as promptly as practicable after the conditions previously disclosed in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed on December 7, 2023 (the “proxy statement”) have been met, subject to any unforeseen circumstances. As set forth in the proxy statement, the Company may, but is under no obligation to, conduct a successive exchange offer for Class B common stock if (i) one year has passed since the initial exchange offer for Class B-1 common stock; and (ii) the estimated interchange reimbursement fees at issue in unresolved claims for damages in the U.S. covered litigation have been reduced by 50% or more since October 1, 2023, as determined by the Company (the “conditions”). More than one year has passed since the launch of the initial exchange offer. As disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K filed on November 6, 2025, the estimated interchange reimbursement fees at issue in unresolved claims for damages in the U.S. covered litigation was approximately $49.6 billion as of October 1, 2023 and approximately $39.4 billion as of October 1, 2025. The Company believes that, together with recent dismissals, and upon the dismissal of certain claims in the action titled 7-Eleven, Inc., et al., v. Visa Inc., et al. , No. 13-cv-4442 (AKH) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which is expected to occur within the next several weeks, the estimated interchange reimbursement fees at issue in unresolved claims for damages in the U.S. covered litigation will fall below 50% of the amount of such fees at issue as of October 1, 2023. Once the conditions are met, the Company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form S-4 that will contain important information about the Company, the exchange offer, and related matters. The Company expects to extend the exchange offer to holders of all outstanding Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock, offering them the ability to exchange their shares for a combination of Class B-3 common stock, which will remain subject to transfer restrictions under Visa’s certificate of incorporation, and freely transferable Class C common stock. This announcement does not constitute an offer to exchange. The timing of the exchange offer will be subject to occurrence of the conditions, review by the SEC of the registration statement, the Company’s outlook of market conditions and other relevant factors at the time. Additional Information and Where to Find It If the Company determines to proceed with an exchange offer for outstanding Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock, the Company will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to describe the terms of the exchange offer. This communication is not a substitute for any exchange offer registration statement, prospectus or other documents the Company may file with the SEC in connection with the foregoing. If and when the Company provides a registration statement relating to a potential exchange offer: STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IN THEIR ENTIRETY CAREFULLY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

In addition, stockholders will be able to obtain free copies of the exchange offer registration statement (if and when available) and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC on Visa’s Investor Relations website at http://investor.visa.com .

No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and otherwise in accordance with applicable law. *** This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, Visa’s expectations concerning the satisfaction of the conditions and the potential commencement and timing of an exchange offer described herein.

The proposed settlement with U.S. merchants of all sizes would provide meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how they accept payments from their customers. The terms of the settlement include: • Credit surcharging . Merchants will have more options to surcharge, including if they do not surcharge other credit networks. • Honor All Cards . Merchants will be able to choose whether to accept U.S. credit cards in distinct categories—commercial, premium consumer and standard consumer. • Lower interchange . The settlement provides for a reduction of the U.S. combined average effective credit interchange rate by 10 bps for five years. • Interchange rate certainty. The settlement will cap posted U.S. credit interchange rates for five years. In addition, standard U.S. consumer credit rates will be capped at 125 bps through the term of the agreement. • Merchant education . A new merchant education program about payment acceptance and cost management will be available to merchants of all sizes. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the court.

Forward-Looking Statements This 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “will,” “is expected,” and other similar expressions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the terms of the settlement agreement and expectations regarding the impact of the settlement agreement. By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i) speak only as of the date they are made; (ii) are not statements of historical fact or guarantees of future performance; and (iii) are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from Visa’s forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the timing and outcome of the court approval process, Visa’s ability to recognize the intended benefits of the settlement, Visa’s ability to effect its obligations under the settlement agreement, and various other factors, including those contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise."

Visa and the LMC have followed the procedures identified in the LMD, and the fourth release amount is now final. The release will result in a downward adjustment of the Class A Common Equivalent Number (as defined in the certificates of designations (“CODs”) for the Preferred Stock), and a partial conversion of the Preferred Stock into Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) in accordance with the applicable COD, each of which was filed as an exhibit to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.

As required by the Litigation Management Deed (“LMD”) entered into at the time of the transaction, at each release assessment, Visa, in consultation with the Litigation Management Committee comprising representatives of former Visa Europe members (“LMC”), performs a conservative assessment of the ongoing risk of liability to Visa and its subsidiaries arising from certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. Visa and the LMC have followed the procedures identified in the LMD, and the third release amount is now final. The release will result in a downward adjustment of the Class A Common Equivalent Number (as defined in the certificates of designations (“CODs”) for the Preferred Stock), and a partial conversion of the Preferred Stock into Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) in accordance with the applicable COD, each of which was filed as an exhibit to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The adjustments were calculated in accordance with the CODs using the volume-weighted average price for Visa’s Class A Common Stock over the 10-day trading period from June 6, 2024 through June 20, 2024. Effective July 19, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Liability Coverage Reduction Amount (as defined in the CODs), Conversion Adjustment (as defined in the CODs) and new Class A Common Equivalent Number for each series of Preferred Stock will be updated as follows: a. Series B Preferred Stock: A Liability Coverage Reduction Amount of approximately $1.1 billion, which will result in a Conversion Adjustment Reduction of 1.695 and reduce the Class A Common Equivalent Number for the Series B Preferred Stock from 2.698 to 1.003; and b. Series C Preferred Stock: A Liability Coverage Reduction Amount of approximately $1.6 billion, which will result in a Conversion Adjustment Reduction of 1.819 and reduce the Class A Common Equivalent Number for the Series C Preferred Stock from 3.605 to 1.786. On the Effective Date, the Company will issue approximately 99,264 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment to account for fractional shares, to holders of record of Preferred Stock as of July 19, 2024. Each holder of Preferred Stock will receive a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the applicable Conversion Adjustment per share of Preferred Stock, divided by 100. The Company will pay cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be automatically converted into 100 shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold Class A Common Stock in accordance with Visa’s certificate of incorporation. The Series A Preferred Stock issued in connection with the release, and the Class A Common Stock issued in connection with any sale of Series A Preferred Stock to a person eligible to hold Class A Common Stock, will be issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 set forth in Section 3(a)(9) thereof."

Item 2.05 Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities On April 29, 2025, Pfizer announced approximately $1.2 billion of additional anticipated savings associated with its ongoing cost realignment program (the “Realigning Our Cost Base Program” or the “Program”) expected to be achieved by the end of 2027, designed to further reduce costs primarily in selling, information and administrative expenses (“SI&A”) driven in large part by enhanced digital enablement, including automation and artificial intelligence (“AI”), and simplification of business processes. Pfizer expects one-time costs to achieve the additional savings to be incurred through 2027 and to total approximately $1.6 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation. Pfizer announced that it remains on track to deliver net cost savings of approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2025, and, with the additional targeted savings, Pfizer now expects total net cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion from this program through 2027. (1) In addition, in connection with Pfizer’s efforts to simplify the structure and sharpen the focus of its research and development (“R&D”) organization, in the first quarter of 2025 Pfizer expanded the Program after having identified additional opportunities to drive improvements in productivity and operational efficiencies through enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes. Savings associated with the simplification of the company’s R&D organization are anticipated to be realized by the end of 2026 and are expected to total approximately $500 million and be reinvested in R&D programs. Pfizer expects one-time costs to implement these initiatives to be incurred through 2026 and to total approximately $600 million, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation. The estimate of costs that Pfizer expects to incur and savings that Pfizer expects to achieve, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ from current expectations. Pfizer may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Program. (1) The net cost savings are calculated versus the midpoint of Pfizer’s 2023 SI&A and R&D expense guidance provided on August 1, 2023."

Modifications to Five-Year Total Shareholder Return Units and Performance Share Awards As disclosed in Item 8.01 of this Current Report, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved modifications to outstanding Five-Year Total Shareholder Return Units and Performance Share Awards granted in 2022 and 2023 to approximately 9,000 eligible participants including the following named executive officers – Albert Bourla, David M. Denton, Mikael Dolsten, Aamir Malik, Angela Hwang and Douglas M. Lankler. The information set forth under Item 8.01 of this Current Report is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. Item 8.01 Other Events Modifications to Five-Year Total Shareholder Return Units and Performance Share Awards In order to retain key colleagues critical to the success of our business and ensure focus on long-term performance by linking their compensation to our total shareholder return, on July 24, 2024, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of our Board of Directors approved modifications to outstanding Five-Year Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs) and Performance Share Awards (PSAs) granted in 2022 and 2023 to eligible active participants. The modifications will affect up to 9,000 active employees holding at least one of these grants, including the following named executive officers – Albert Bourla, David M. Denton, Mikael Dolsten, Aamir Malik, Angela Hwang and Douglas M. Lankler. Current outstanding TSRUs represent an important retention tool while aligning the interests of participants with shareholders by providing value tied to absolute total shareholder return. The Committee approved modifications to the Five-Year TSRUs granted to eligible participants in 2022 and 2023 to provide those participants the ability to elect to extend their respective terms by two additional years. If such an election is made, the settlement period for Five-Year TSRUs granted in 2022 will end in February 2029 rather than 2027, and the settlement period for Five-Year TSRUs granted in 2023 will end in February 2030 rather than 2028. In addition, the vesting period will be extended by two years so that these 2022 and 2023 TSRUs will now vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date instead of the third anniversary. Further, the treatment of TSRUs in the event of a holder’s death will be updated, to provide for settlement based on the greater of binomial value or intrinsic value, which is consistent with the terms provided in the 2024 grants. All other terms of the 2022 and 2023 Five-Year TSRUs will remain unchanged. Current outstanding PSAs align rewards to both a strategic financial performance metric, adjusted net income, over three one-year periods, and relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance as compared to the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical (DRG) Index over a cumulative three-year period. The modifications approved in respect of PSA awards granted in 2022 and 2023 provide eligible participants the ability to elect to modify the 2022 and 2023 PSAs, such that the three-year performance period for the PSAs will be extended by two years and the applicable performance will be measured over the final three years of the extended term. If such an election is made, the PSAs granted in 2022 will be vesting and settling in 2027 rather than 2025, and the PSAs granted in 2023 will be vesting and settling in 2028 rather than 2026. The Committee will determine the applicable adjusted net income goal for each of 2025, 2026 and 2027 in accordance with the terms of the program at the beginning of each respective one-year period. In addition, the performance range for the operating goal will be 0% – 200%, and the relative total shareholder return modifier will be capped at 25 percentage points, consistent with market practice but subject to the overall 200% maximum payout. Any payout is capped at target if total shareholder return is negative for the performance period. In addition, the treatment of PSAs in the event of a holder’s death will be updated to provide payouts based on a combination of actual performance and target performance, which is consistent with terms provided in the 2024 grants. All other terms of the 2022 and 2023 PSAs will remain unchanged. In approving the modifications described above, the Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, made its decision after careful consideration of its desire to ensure that the outstanding long-term incentive awards provide sufficient retentive value of key talent especially in light of the extraordinary impact of the COVID pandemic on the Company and its stock price, and continue the alignment of executives' interests with those of shareholders with a focus on stock price recovery. The Committee believes these changes are in the best interests of shareholders as they will provide further incentive to motivate and retain key colleagues and will continue to align pay with performance for a longer period of time. In order to implement the modifications, the Company will initiate a tender offer (the Modification Offer) to allow active colleagues to affirmatively accept the modification of their 2022 and 2023 Five-Year TSRUs and/or 2022 and 2023 PSAs, with such terms and conditions (consistent with the foregoing) as shall be set forth in the Modification Offer documents to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This communication is for informational purposes only and is not an offer nor a solicitation of an offer to exchange any of Pfizer’s securities. The Modification Offer has not yet commenced. The offer to modify will be made only pursuant to the Modification Offer and other related materials, which are expected to be made available to all eligible holders of the 2022 and 2023 Five-Year TSRUs and/or 2022 and 2023 PSAs shortly after commencement of the Modification Offer, at no expense to such holders. You should read those materials and the documents referenced therein carefully when they become available because they will contain important information, including the various terms and conditions of the Modification Offer. Pfizer will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (Tender Offer Statement) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Tender Offer Statement, including the Modification Offer and other related materials, will be available, at no charge, via the Fidelity NetBenefits online portal, at our website https://pfizer.com/financial-information/sec-filings, and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Pfizer urges you to read those materials carefully prior to making any decisions with respect to the Modification Offer and recommends that you consult your tax and financial advisors to address questions regarding your decision."

This cost reduction program (the “program”) will span multiple years, and is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements. Given the complexity in manufacturing and longer lead times required to make changes, this program will be a multi-phased effort. The first phase of the program is focused on operational efficiencies and is expected to deliver savings of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2027, some of which is expected to begin being realized in 2025. The one-time costs to achieve the savings associated with the first phase of the program are expected to be approximately $1.7 billion and primarily include severance and implementation costs. These costs will be recorded primarily in 2024, with cash outlays expected in 2025 and 2026. The estimate of costs that Pfizer expects to incur for the first phase of the program, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ from current expectations. Pfizer may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the first phase of the program as well as for potential future phases.

To provide our stakeholders transparency and confidence in the Company’s practices, the Company, as previously announced, has proactively launched its own initiative to conduct third party reviews of policies, practices, and associated processes and performance metrics for risk assessment coding, managed care practices, and pharmacy services.

Material Cybersecurity Incidents. On February 21, 2024, UnitedHealth Group (the “Company”) identified a suspected nation-state associated cyber security threat actor had gained access to some of the Change Healthcare information technology systems. Immediately upon detection of this outside threat, the Company proactively isolated the impacted systems from other connecting systems in the interest of protecting our partners and patients, to contain, assess and remediate the incident. The Company is working diligently to restore those systems and resume normal operations as soon as possible, but cannot estimate the duration or extent of the disruption at this time. The Company has retained leading security experts, is working with law enforcement and notified customers, clients and certain government agencies. At this time, the Company believes the network interruption is specific to Change Healthcare systems, and all other systems across the Company are operational. During the disruption, certain networks and transactional services may not be accessible. The Company is providing updates on the incident at https://status.changehealthcare.com/incidents/hqpjz25fn3n7 . Please access that site for further information. As of the date of this report, the Company has not determined the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Following the results of these trials, AbbVie began an evaluation of the emraclidine intangible asset for impairment which resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. On July 25, 2025, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2025 Restructuring Program) designed to position the Company for its next chapter of growth and to successfully advance its pipeline and launch new products across multiple therapeutic areas. As part of this program, the Company expects to eliminate certain positions in sales and administrative organizations, as well as research and development. The Company will, however, continue to hire employees into new roles across all strategic growth areas of the business. In addition, the Company will reduce its global real estate footprint and continue to optimize its manufacturing network, aligning the geography of its global manufacturing footprint to its customers and reflecting changes in the Company’s business. Most actions contemplated under the 2025 Restructuring Program are expected to be largely completed by the end of 2027, with the exception of certain manufacturing actions, which are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2029. The cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program are estimated to be approximately $3.0 billion, of which approximately 60% will be cash, relating primarily to employee separation expense and contractual termination costs. The remainder of the costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities. The Company expects the actions under the 2025 Restructuring Program to result in annual cost savings of approximately $1.7 billion, which will be substantially realized by the end of 2027. The 2025 Restructuring Program is part of the Company’s multiyear optimization initiative anticipated to achieve $3.0 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2027, which will be fully reinvested into strategic growth areas of the business."

At the effective time of the Merger, each Pioneer restricted stock unit (each, a “ Pioneer RSU ”) (whether vested or unvested, other than those granted on or after October 10, 2023 that remained unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), each Pioneer restricted stock unit issued by Pioneer to a non-employee member of the Pioneer board of directors (each, a “ Pioneer DSU ”) (whether vested or unvested) and each Pioneer performance stock unit (each, a “ Pioneer Performance Unit ”) (whether vested or unvested) outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was, without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Pioneer or the holder thereof, canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the total number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to each respective Pioneer RSU, Pioneer DSU and Pioneer Performance Unit (with the number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to each Pioneer Performance Unit determined based on the maximum level of performance), subject to applicable tax withholding. Additionally, each share of restricted Pioneer common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger became fully vested, Pioneer withheld a number of such shares necessary to satisfy any tax withholding, and the remainder of such shares was converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each Pioneer RSU granted on or after October 10, 2023 that was outstanding and remained unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time was converted into a number of Company restricted stock units equal to the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the total number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to such Pioneer RSU.

The First Supplemental Indenture provides that, as of the effective time of the Merger, the right of the holders of the Notes that were outstanding as of the completion of the Merger to convert each $1,000 principal amount of such Notes into shares of Pioneer common stock was changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Notes into the number of shares of Company common stock that a holder of a number of shares of Pioneer common stock equal to the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Indenture) immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger would have been entitled to receive upon the completion of the Merger; provided that, at and after the effective time of the Merger (A) Pioneer will continue to have the right to determine the form of consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and (B) any amount payable in cash upon conversion of the Notes in accordance the terms of the Indenture will continue to be payable in cash. As described above, upon the completion of the Merger, each then-outstanding share of Pioneer common stock was converted into the right to receive 2.3234 shares of Company common stock, resulting in an adjusted initial Conversion Rate of 25.4503 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. As of the date hereof, approximately $450 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding. The foregoing description of the First Supplemental Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the First Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference."

Mr. Hess will also serve as a member of the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board. Mr. Hess, age 71, served as Chief Executive Officer of Hess Corporation (“Hess”) from 1995 until July 18, 2025, and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hess Midstream GP LLC, the General Partner of Hess Midstream LP, from 2014 until July 18, 2025.

The number of restricted stock units to be received by Mr. Hess is equal to the product of (x) $235,000 and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the Annual Compensation Cycle (as defined in the NED Plan) beginning on the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Annual Compensation Cycle, and dividing that product by the closing Chevron common stock price on the Effective Date. Mr. Hess will also be entitled to receive the annual cash retainer for non-employee Directors of $155,000, which will be prorated. Memorandum of Understanding On July 14, 2025, in anticipation of and subject to the closing of the Corporation’s previously announced acquisition of Hess, which closed on July 18, 2025 (the “Closing”), Chevron U.S.A.

In connection with the proposed transfer, Chevron USA intends to terminate AirCo’s lease in the Aircraft, HFO or its designee is expected to pay to the lessor of the Aircraft the fair market value of the Aircraft (expected to be approximately $25 million to $30 million), and Chevron USA is expected to be responsible for the balance of any termination fee in excess of such fair market value (expected to be approximately $5 million to $10 million) with respect to the existing lease. Prior to October 1, 2025, Mr. Hess is expected to continue to have access to the Aircraft for personal use in exchange for Mr. Hess’s continued payment of incremental costs for such use of the Aircraft under an existing timesharing agreement. · Effective 90 days after the Closing, Chevron USA is expected to cause the assignment of its interest in HLOGO LLC, a limited liability company that holds the intellectual property rights with respect to the “Hess” name and all trademarks and logos that contain “Hess” (collectively, the “Transferred Trademarks”), and the www.hess.com domain and any other domains or social media accounts that contain “Hess” (collectively, the “Electronic Assets”) to HFO or its designee.

(e) 2025 Executive Compensation Review and 2025 Base Salarie s On January 29, 2025, the independent Directors of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) conducted an annual review of the compensation of Chevron’s executive officers, including Michael K. Wirth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”); Eimear P. Bonner, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and the other named executive officers of Chevron identified in Chevron’s 2024 proxy statement who are currently employed by Chevron, Mark A. Nelson, Vice Chairman; A. Nigel Hearne, Executive Vice President, Senior Advisor; and R. Hewitt Pate, Vice President and General Counsel (collectively, the “Named Executive Officers”). Following such review, the independent Directors of the Board approved no change to Mr. Wirth’s annual base salary of $1,900,000, and ratified the decision of the Management Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) to increase the annual base salaries of the principal financial officer and the other Named Executive Officers, as follows: (i) an increase of $50,000 for Ms. Bonner, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,050,000; (ii) an increase of $50,000 for Mr. Nelson, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,325,000; (iii) no change to Mr. Hearne’s annual base salary of $1,075,000 in anticipation of his upcoming retirement from Chevron; and (iv) an increase of $50,000 for Mr. Pate, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,200,000. All base salary increases will be effective March 1, 2025. Chevron Incentive Plan On January 29, 2025, the independent Directors of the Board approved no change to the 2025 target percentage under the Chevron Incentive Plan (“CIP”) for Mr. Wirth (165 percent) and ratified the decision of the Committee to make no changes to the target bonus percentages for 2025 under the CIP for each of Ms. Bonner (110 percent), Mr. Nelson (120 percent), and Mr. Pate (110 percent). Mr. Hearne will not receive a CIP award for the 2025 performance cycle due to his upcoming retirement from Chevron. 2025 Equity Awards to Named Executive Officers On January 29, 2025, the independent Directors of the Board also approved the equity grant target value of $17,500,000 to Mr. Wirth and ratified the following equity grant target values approved by the Committee under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (“2022 LTIP”) with an award grant date of February 4, 2025 (the “Grant Date”): (i) Ms. Bonner, $4,329,000; (ii) Mr. Nelson, $6,902,500; and (iii) Mr. Pate, $4,329,000. Mr. Hearne will not receive an equity grant in 2025 due to his upcoming retirement from Chevron. Each 2025 award under the 2022 LTIP comprises three equity vehicles: performance shares (50%), restricted stock units (25%), and stock options (25%). The actual number of performance shares and standard restricted stock units to be granted to each of Messrs. Wirth, Nelson, Pate, and Ms. Bonner will be determined by dividing the target value of each equity vehicle by the closing price of Chevron’s common stock on the Grant Date. The actual number of stock options granted to each of Messrs. Wirth, Nelson, and Pate, and Ms. Bonner will be determined based on the Black-Scholes value of a stock option on the Grant Date. The stock options have a ten-year term, and vest one-third ratably on each of February 10, 2026, February 10, 2027, and February 10, 2028, except as described further herein. The exercise price for the stock options will be equal to the closing price of Chevron’s common stock on the Grant Date. The standard restricted stock units awarded vest one-third ratably on each of February 10, 2026, February 10, 2027, and February 10, 2028, and will settle in shares of Chevron common stock, with the value based on the closing price of Chevron common stock on the vesting date (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and will accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units, except as described further herein. The restricted stock unit award payout is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period for executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027) (the “Performance Period”) depending upon Chevron’s relative performance, weighted 70 percent based on relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) as measured against the large-cap integrated energy companies BP p.l.c., ExxonMobil Corporation, Shell p.l.c., and TotalEnergies SE (collectively, the “LTIP Performance Share Peer Group”), and the S&P 500 Total Return Index (“S&P 500 Index”); and 30 percent based on relative Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) Improvement as measured against the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group, as follows: Relative ranking 1 2 3 4 5 6 TSR Modifier (1) (70% weight, ranking includes S&P 500 Index) 200% 160% 120% 80% 40% 0% ROCE Improvement Modifier (2) (30% weight, ranking excludes S&P 500 Index) 200% 150% 100% 50% 0% n/a 1. Chevron’s TSR for the Performance Period as compared to the TSR of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group and the S&P 500 Index. The TSR Modifier is based on Chevron’s TSR ranking for the three-year Performance Period compared to the TSR of each competitor in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group and the S&P 500 Index (from best TSR to lowest TSR) as set forth in the table. In the event Chevron’s measured TSR is less than 1 percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) of the nearest member(s) of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group and the S&P 500 Index, the results will be considered a tie, and the TSR Modifier will be determined by averaging the TSR Modifiers in the tied positions. In the event of negative TSR for the Performance Period, any above-target TSR Modifier will be reduced by 20 percent for the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 2. Chevron’s ROCE Improvement (“ROCE-I”), measured by percentage point change, as compared with the ROCE-I for the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group. The ROCE-I Modifier is based on Chevron’s ROCE-I ranking for the three-year period commencing with the quarter preceding the beginning of the Performance Period and ending one quarter prior to the end of the Performance Period, compared to the ROCE-I of each company in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group (from best ROCE-I to lowest ROCE-I) as set forth in the table. In the event Chevron’s measured ROCE-I is less than one half of a percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) of the nearest member(s) of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group, the results will be considered a tie, and the ROCE-I Modifier will be determined by dividing the sum of the ROCE-I Modifiers in the tied positions by the number of members of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group in the tie. The performance shares will accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance shares and will vest on December 31, 2027, with payout in shares of Chevron common stock, subject to the payout modifiers, except as described further herein. The payout, if any, will be based on the number of performance shares granted, including dividend equivalents; multiplied by a performance share multiplier, which is the sum of the weighted TSR Modifier and the weighted ROCE-I Modifier, each of which is determined as described above, rounded to the nearest whole percentage; then multiplied by the closing price of Chevron’s common stock as of the certification date of the performance share multiplier by the Committee. The Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. Under the 2022 LTIP award terms, if these individuals’ employment terminates for any reason prior to February 10, 2026, the above-described stock option, restricted stock unit, and performance share awards will be forfeited. Since Messrs. Wirth, Nelson, and Pate each have reached 90 points under the 2022 LTIP rules (for Messrs. Wirth and Nelson, the sum of years of age and years of service; and for Mr. Pate, pursuant to the terms of an agreement relating solely to the vesting of his outstanding equity awards), on February 10, 2026, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described stock options will vest upon the termination of their employment on or after that date for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules), and such options will be exercisable through the remainder of the original 10-year term. In addition, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described standard restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest upon the termination of their employment on or after February 10, 2026, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules), but will not be vested and paid out until the respective original vest date of February 10, 2027 or February 10, 2028, as applicable. Upon termination of employment, the post-vesting holding period for the restricted stock unit payout will be removed. Further, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described performance share awards will continue to vest upon the termination of their employment on or after February 10, 2026, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined in the 2022 LTIP rules), but will not be fully vested and will not be paid out prior to December 31, 2027. Since Ms. Bonner has more than 75 points but less than 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the 2022 LTIP, on February 10, 2026, a percentage of the unvested portion of the above-described stock option will vest upon the termination of her employment on or after that date for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules) and remain exercisable for five years from the date of termination or the remaining term of the award, if less. In addition, a percentage of the unvested portion of the above-described standard restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest upon the termination of her employment on or after February 10, 2026, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules), but will not be vested and paid out until the respective original vest date of February 10, 2027 or February 10, 2028, as applicable. Upon termination of employment, the post-vesting holding period for the restricted stock unit payout will be removed. Further, a percentage of the unvested portion of the above-described performance share awards will continue to vest upon the termination of her employment on or after February 10, 2026, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined in the 2022 LTIP rules), but will not be vested and will not be paid out prior to December 31, 2027. The portion of Ms. Bonner’s unvested stock options that will vest will be determined by multiplying the number of stock options granted, as applicable, by the number of completed months from the grant date to the date of termination, up to a maximum of 36 months, divided by 36 months, and the rest will be forfeited. The portion of Ms. Bonner’s unvested restricted stock units that will vest will be determined by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the number of completed months from the grant date to the date of termination, up to a maximum of 36 months, divided by 36 months, and the rest will be forfeited. The portion of Ms. Bonner’s unvested performance shares that will vest will be determined by multiplying the number of performance shares granted, as applicable, by the number of completed months from the Performance Period start date to the date of termination, up to a maximum of 36 months, divided by 36 months, and the rest will be forfeited."

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Marathon (the “ Merger ”), with Marathon surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger, and, (2) at the effective time of the Merger (the “ Effective Time ”), each outstanding share of common stock of Marathon (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.255 shares of common stock of ConocoPhillips. The Merger Agreement also specifies the treatment of outstanding Marathon equity awards in connection with the Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including (1) the receipt of the required approvals from Marathon stockholders, (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “ HSR Act ”), (3) certain other specified regulatory approvals having been obtained, (4) the absence of any governmental order or law that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited, (5) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by ConocoPhillips pursuant to which the shares of ConocoPhillips common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”), and (6) the authorization for listing of ConocoPhillips common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger on the NYSE. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon (1) the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions), (2) the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (3) the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party and (4) the receipt of an officer’s certificate from the other party confirming that the foregoing conditions (1)-(3) have been satisfied. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of ConocoPhillips and Marathon relating to their respective businesses, financial statements and public filings, in each case generally subject to customary materiality qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants for each party including, subject to certain exceptions, covenants to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to refrain from taking certain actions without the other party’s consent. ConocoPhillips and Marathon also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, to obtain expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and to obtain other specified regulatory approvals, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, Marathon will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative competing proposals from third parties, to provide non-public information to third parties and to engage in discussions with third parties regarding alternative competing proposals, subject to customary exceptions. Marathon is required to call a meeting of its stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that its stockholders approve the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of ConocoPhillips and Marathon, including, among others, if the consummation of the Merger does not occur on or before May 28, 2025 (subject to two potential extensions to November 28, 2025 and May 28, 2026 if the required regulatory approvals have not been received but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at closing)). Additionally, the Merger Agreement permits Marathon, subject to compliance with certain requirements and payment of a termination fee (described below), to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior alternative competing proposal than the Merger. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, the (1) termination by Marathon to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior alternative competing proposal than the Merger, (2) termination by ConocoPhillips in the event of a change of recommendation by the Marathon board of directors or (3) termination by ConocoPhillips because Marathon, its subsidiaries or any of its directors or officers materially breached its non-solicitation obligations, Marathon would be required to pay ConocoPhillips a termination fee of $557 million. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated because of a failure of Marathon’s stockholders to approve the Merger, Marathon will be required to pay ConocoPhillips $86 million. In no event will ConocoPhillips be entitled to receive more than one termination fee, net of any expense reimbursement.

The Company issued press releases on January 15, 2026 and January 16, 2026 announcing the events described above.

Douglas McMillon, president and chief executive officer of Walmart Inc. (the “Company”), notified the Company that he will retire from his position as president and chief executive officer, effective on the close of business on January 31, 2026. On February 1, 2026, Mr. McMillon will continue in his capacity as an executive officer of the Company, he will report to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and he will continue to be employed as an associate of the Company through January 31, 2027. Mr. McMillon will also continue his service as a director on the Board until the June 2026 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. (c) On November 13, 2025, the Board appointed Mr. John R. Furner, age 51, as president and chief executive officer of the Company, effective February 1, 2026. Mr. Furner was also elected to the Board on November 13, 2025. Since November 2019, Mr. Furner has served as the Company’s executive vice president and chief executive officer for Walmart U.S. and he will continue in that role through January 31, 2026. Prior to becoming the Company’s executive vice president and chief executive officer for Walmart U.S., Mr. Furner served as the executive vice president and president and chief executive officer of Sam’s Club beginning in February 2017. Mr. Furner joined the Company as an hourly associate in 1993 and over the years held leadership roles across merchandising, operations, and sourcing. No compensatory changes occurred to Mr. Furner’s compensation, with any such compensatory changes for his new position occurring in the ordinary course through the Company’s Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board (the “CMDC”) prior to the effective date of the new position. The Company issued a press release on November 14, 2025 announcing Mr. McMillon’s new role, the appointment of Mr. Furner in his new role and the election of Mr. Furner to the Board. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. The following information indirectly involving Mr. Furner was also reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 (“fiscal 2025”) and was disclosed in the Company’s 2025 proxy statement filed on April 24, 2025. Jason Turner, a management associate in Walmart U.S., is the brother-in-law of Mr. Furner, an executive officer of Walmart. For fiscal 2025, Walmart paid Mr. Turner a salary of approximately $111,350, a payment pursuant to the cash incentive plan of approximately $26,600, and other benefits totaling approximately $7,300 (including Walmart’s matching contributions to Mr. Turner’s 401(k) Plan account and health insurance premiums). In fiscal 2025, Mr. Turner also received a grant of 505 restricted stock units with a calculated value of approximately $28,900 on the date of grant. Mr. Turner continues to be an Associate of the company, and, in fiscal 2026, he may receive compensation and other benefits in amounts similar to or greater than those he received during fiscal 2025. The Company entered into a covenant not to compete agreement with Mr. Furner in May 2011. This covenant not to compete agreement is substantially similar to the form of covenant not to compete agreement entered into with executive officers of the Company that is attached as Exhibit 10 (p) to the Company’s Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2011. The covenant not to compete agreement prohibits Mr. Furner, for a period of two years following his termination of employment with the Company for any reason, from participating in a business that competes with the Company and from soliciting the Company’s associates for employment. The covenant not to compete agreement also provides that, if Mr. Furner is terminated from the Company for any reason, other than his violation of the Company’s policies, the Company will continue to pay his base salary for two years following termination of employment, less any earnings he receives from other employment. (d) Mr. Furner was also elected to the Board on November 13, 2025 and there were no compensatory arrangements entered into in connection with his election to the Board. Mr. Furner was also appointed to the Board’s Executive Committee. (e) On November 13, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. McMillon, which will continue through January 31, 2027 (the “Agreement”). Beginning February 1, 2026, Mr. McMillon’s salary will be $1.5 million on an annual basis, he will not be eligible to participate in the Company’s Management Incentive Plan following January 31, 2026, and his restricted stock and performance shares will continue to vest in the normal course through January 31, 2027. The Company will accelerate certain restricted stock grants for 11,524 shares that are scheduled to vest on January 11, 2028 and certain performance share grants for 195,898 shares (based on 100% performance, with the actual number of shares to be paid out based on fiscal 2026 performance) scheduled to vest on January 31, 2028 to instead vest on January 31, 2027, as long as Mr. McMillon remains employed with the Company through January 31, 2027. The Agreement, which also operates as an amendment to Mr. McMillon’s covenant not to compete agreement, extends the non-competition provisions through January 31, 2029, and the non-solicitation provisions through the date that is six (6) months following January 31, 2027."

(the “Company”) entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions named therein as lenders (the “364‑Day Credit Agreement”). The 364‑Day Credit Agreement provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the “364‑Day Credit Facility”), which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including supporting the issuance of commercial paper. In addition to loans in U.S. Dollars, borrowings under the 364‑Day Credit Facility will be available in Canadian Dollar, Euro, Sterling, Yen and any other currency that is freely convertible into U.S. Dollars and agreed to by the administrative agent and the then existing lenders. The 364-Day Credit Facility matures on March 6, 2026 and all unpaid amounts are repayable on that date, assuming the maturity date is not extended. The Company may, upon the agreement of either the then existing lenders or of additional banks not currently party to the 364-Day Credit Agreement, increase the commitments under the 364-Day Credit Facility to up to $1.5 billion. The Company may also request renewal of the 364‑Day Credit Facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. As of March 7, 2025, the Company is the only borrower under the 364-Day Credit Facility. However, the 364‑Day Credit Agreement allows for the Company to designate additional subsidiary borrowers from time to time. In the event that any subsidiary of the Company becomes a borrower, the Company has agreed to provide a guarantee in respect of any such subsidiary’s obligations in relation with the revolving credit facility. Borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the 364-Day Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (a) Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin or (b) a base rate defined as the highest of (i) the Bank of America “prime rate”, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) one month Term SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for Term SOFR loans will range from 0.3575% to 0.690% based on the public ratings of the Company’s long-term, senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced indebtedness for borrowed money. The Company may select interest periods of one, three or six months for Term SOFR loans, subject to availability. Interest shall be payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. The 364-Day Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional liens; engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions; and use proceeds of loans under the 364-Day Credit Facility. The 364‑Day Credit Agreement does not include any financial covenants. Payment of the loans, including any unpaid accrued interest, may be accelerated following certain customary events of default. Certain of the parties to the 364-Day Credit Agreement and/or their affiliates have provided and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and/or advisory services to the Company for which they receive customary fees and expenses. Five Year Credit Facility On March 7, 2025, the Company also entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions named therein as lenders (the “Five Year Credit Agreement”). The Five Year Credit Agreement provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings pursuant to an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Five Year Credit Facility”), which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including supporting the issuance of commercial paper. In addition to loans in U.S. Dollars, borrowings under the Five Year Credit Facility will be available in Canadian Dollar, Euro, Sterling, Yen and any other currency that is freely convertible into U.S. Dollars and agreed to by the administrative agent and the then existing lenders. The Five Year Credit Facility matures on March 7, 2030 and all unpaid amounts are repayable on that date, assuming the maturity date is not extended. The Company may, upon the agreement of either the then existing lenders or of additional banks not currently party to the Five Year Credit Agreement, increase the commitments under the Five Year Credit Facility to up to $3 billion. The Company may also request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date, provided that the maturity date may not be extended beyond March 7, 2032. As of March 7, 2025, the Company is the only borrower under the Five Year Credit Facility. However, the Five Year Credit Agreement allows for the Company to designate additional subsidiary borrowers from time to time. In the event that any subsidiary of the Company becomes a borrower, the Company has agreed to provide a guarantee in respect of any such subsidiary’s obligations in relation with the revolving credit facility. Borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the Five Year Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (a) Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin or (b) a base rate defined as the highest of (i) the Bank of America “prime rate”, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one month Term SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for Term SOFR loans will range from 0.345% to 0.680% based on the public ratings of the Company’s long-term, senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced indebtedness for borrowed money. The Company may select interest periods of one, three or six months for Term SOFR loans, subject to availability.

(the “Company”) entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions named therein as lenders (the “364‑Day Credit Agreement”). The 364‑Day Credit Agreement provides for up to $1.0 billion of borrowings pursuant to a 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the “364‑Day Credit Facility”), which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including supporting the issuance of commercial paper. In addition to loans in U.S. Dollars, borrowings under the 364‑Day Credit Facility will be available in Canadian Dollar, Euro, Sterling, Yen and any other currency that is freely convertible into U.S. Dollars and agreed to by the administrative agent and the then existing lenders. The 364-Day Credit Facility matures on March 7, 2025, assuming the maturity date is not extended. The Company may, upon the agreement of either of the then existing lenders or of additional banks not currently party to the 364-Day Credit Agreement, increase the commitments under the 364-Day Credit Facility to up to $1.5 billion. The Company may also request renewal of the 364‑Day Credit Facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. As of March 8, 2024, the Company is the only borrower under the 364-Day Credit Facility. However, the 364‑Day Credit Agreement allows for the Company to designate additional subsidiary borrowers from time to time. In the event that any subsidiary of the Company becomes a borrower, the Company has agreed to provide a guarantee in respect of any such subsidiary’s obligations in relation with the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (a) Term SOFR plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin or (b) a base rate defined as the highest of (i) the Bank of America “prime rate”, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) one month Term SOFR plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for Term SOFR loans will range from 0.3575% to 0.690% based on the public ratings of the Company’s long-term, senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced indebtedness for borrowed money. The Company may select interest periods of one, three or six months for Term SOFR loans, subject to availability. Interest shall be payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. The 364-Day Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional liens; engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions; and use proceeds of loans under the 364-Day Credit Facility. The 364‑Day Credit Agreement does not include any financial covenants.

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement Termination of Prior 364-Day Credit Agreement On March 8, 2024, concurrently with the Company’s entry into the 364-Day Credit Agreement described in Item 1.01 hereof, the Company terminated the existing Credit Agreement dated March 10, 2023, which provided for up to $1.0 billion of borrowings in U.S. Dollars pursuant to a 364‑day unsecured revolving credit facility, with the banks, financial institutions and other lenders signatory thereto (the “Prior 364‑Day Credit Agreement”). The Prior 364‑Day Credit Agreement contained covenants that, among other things, limited or restricted the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional liens; engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and use proceeds of loans under the Prior 364-Day Credit Agreement. The Prior 364‑Day Credit Agreement did not include any financial covenants. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of March 8, 2024.

Under the Agreement, Boeing will pay a fee of between 0.125% and 0.300% per annum on the commitments, depending on Boeing’s credit rating. Borrowings under the Agreement that are based on SOFR will generally bear interest at an annual rate equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Agreement) plus between 1.250% and 1.700% per annum, depending on Boeing’s credit rating. All other borrowings under the Agreement will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the highest of (1) the rate announced publicly by Citibank, from time to time, as its “base” rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.00%, plus in each of (1), (2) and (3) between 0.250% and 0.700% per annum, depending on Boeing’s credit rating.

Under the Agreement, each of the Parties made customary representations, warranties and covenants, and following the Closing (as defined in the Agreement), Buyer and the Company have agreed to provide one another with customary indemnities with respect to certain assets and liabilities allocated between their respective post-transaction businesses pursuant to the Pre-Closing Reorganization and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. The Agreement contains customary conditions to Closing, including: (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended and the receipt of certain other required regulatory approvals; (ii) the absence of governmental orders prohibiting the Closing; (iii) the consummation of the Pre-Closing Reorganization in all material respects by no later than the Termination Date (as defined below); (iv) that the Parties have performed and complied in all material respects with all of the covenants and agreements contained in the Agreement to be performed and complied with by them at or prior to the Closing; (v) that no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred and is continuing as of the Closing; and (vi) that the representations and warranties of the Parties are true and correct, subject to certain materiality standards, as of the Closing. The Agreement may be terminated by either the Company or Buyer prior to Closing under certain circumstances, including if certain closing conditions in the Agreement have not been satisfied or waived by January 17, 2026 (the “Termination Date”), provided that either the Company or Buyer may extend the Termination Date (i) by up to an additional 90 days in certain circumstances where the required regulatory approvals have not been received (or, in the case of certain required regulatory approvals, the time periods for approval have lapsed), or (ii) by 30-day increments, up to a maximum of 90 days, where the Pre-Closing Reorganization has not been effectuated. Buyer is required to pay the Company a termination fee of $844.0 million if the Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, including, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions specified therein, where Buyer has breached its covenants under the Agreement or has failed to consummate the Closing at a time when all conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Parties. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement were made only for purposes of the Agreement as of the specific date therein, were solely for the benefit of the Parties, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the Parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk among the Parties instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the Parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures. Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. On April 22, 2025, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the Agreement.

Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates,” and other similar words or expressions, or the negative thereof, generally can be used to help identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to the anticipated benefits of the transaction, future collaborations between the parties, and the timetable for completing the transaction, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to general conditions in the economy and our industry, including those due to regulatory changes, the ability of the parties to consummate the transaction, and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law."

Morgan Securities LLC, as the representatives (the “Representatives”) of the underwriters (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 100,000,000 depositary shares (the “Depositary Shares”), each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, liquidation preference $1,000.00 per share, par value $1.00 per share (the “Preferred Stock” and such offering, the “Depositary Shares Offering”). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15,000,000 Depositary Shares, solely to cover over-allotments. On October 29, 2024, the Underwriters exercised this option in full. The Depositary Shares Offering closed on October 31, 2024. A validity opinion issued by the Company’s counsel with respect to the Depositary Shares sold in the Depositary Shares Offering and the Preferred Stock underlying such Depositary Shares is filed as Exhibit 5.1 hereto. The Depositary Shares Offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 15, 2024 (Registration No. 333-282628), a base prospectus, dated October 22, 2024, included as part of the registration statement and a prospectus supplement, dated October 28, 2024 and filed with the SEC on October 29, 2024. In connection with the Depositary Shares Offering, the Company filed a certificate of designations (the “Certificate of Designations”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, including a form of certificate for the Preferred Stock (the “Form of Certificate”), to establish the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of the Preferred Stock.

The foregoing descriptions of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, Certificate of Designations, Form of Certificate, Deposit Agreement and Form of Depositary Receipt are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, Certificate of Designations, Form of Certificate, Deposit Agreement and Form of Depositary Receipt, a copy of each of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Subject to certain exceptions, so long as any share of Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on the common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”) or any other shares of junior stock, and no Common Stock or other junior stock or parity stock will be, directly or indirectly, purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company or any of its subsidiaries unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid upon, or a sufficient sum or number of shares of Common Stock have been set apart for the payment of such dividends upon, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. Holders of the Depositary Shares will be entitled to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights, subject to the provisions of the Deposit Agreement. The Preferred Stock will accumulate dividends (which may be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of Common Stock or in any combination of cash and Common Stock) at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% on the liquidation preference thereof, which is $1,000 per share, payable when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof), on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025 and ending on, and including, October 15, 2027. Unless earlier converted, each outstanding share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert for settlement on or about October 15, 2027, into between 5.8280 and 6.9940 shares of Common Stock (and, correspondingly, each Depositary Share will automatically convert into between 0.2914 and 0.3497 shares of Common Stock), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, determined based on the average volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day prior to October 15, 2027. Other than during a fundamental change conversion period (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), at any time prior to the mandatory conversion settlement date, a holder of 20 Depositary Shares may cause the Depositary to convert one share of Preferred Stock, on such holder’s behalf, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the minimum conversion rate of 5.8280, subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. In addition, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, each holder of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation preference in the amount of $1,000 per share of the Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid dividends on the shares to, but excluding, the date fixed for liquidation, winding-up or dissolution to be paid out of the Company’s assets available for distribution to the Company’s shareholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to the Company’s creditors and holders of any senior stock and before any payment or distribution is made to holders of junior stock, including the Common Stock.

(the “Company”) is providing an update relating to the estimated impact of tariffs on its financial results. Since the Company released its second quarter earnings on August 5, 2025, several additional clarifications and additional tariffs have been announced. These clarifications and additional tariffs will impact the Company’s financial results for the third quarter and the remainder of 2025. While the Company continues to take initial mitigating actions to reduce this impact, trade and tariff negotiations continue to be fluid. Based on the changes and clarifications announced since August 5, 2025 and expected to be in place as of August 31, 2025, the Company now expects the net impact from incremental tariffs introduced in 2025 will be between approximately $500 million to $600 million for the third quarter and approximately $1.5 to $1.8 billion for 2025. Including the net impact from incremental tariffs, the Company now expects its full year adjusted operating profit margin to be near the bottom of the target margin range. The revised estimated net impact from tariffs is not expected to affect the Company’s sales and revenue outlook provided during the second quarter earnings call on August 5, 2025. Further updates will be provided in the Company’s third-quarter earnings announcement and conference call on October 29, 2025.

As previously disclosed in its January 29, 2026 press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings (the “Earnings Release”), Honeywell classified its Productivity Solutions and Services (“PSS”) and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions (“WWS”) businesses as assets held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2025 and announced impairment charges for the PSS and WWS assets held for sale that were reflected in the Honeywell’s year-end results. In connection with Honeywell’s ongoing sale process for the businesses, it reviews information relevant to the financial analysis associated with the sale as it becomes available. As a result, after the Earnings Release, Honeywell recorded incremental impairment charges that are reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. On February 17, 2026, Honeywell issued a press release describing the financial impact of these adjustments, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act."

(the “Company”) intends to realign its business units comprising its Industrial Automation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions reportable business segments. This realignment will result in the formation of a new reportable business segment, Process Automation and Technology, and also result in a new composition of the Industrial Automation reportable business segment. Process Automation and Technology will include the core process solutions of the Honeywell Process Solutions business, which is currently a part of Industrial Automation, and UOP, which is currently reported in Energy and Sustainability Solutions. As a result, the Company will no longer report results for the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment (the Advanced Materials business, which was formerly reported in Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was spun off on October 30, 2025). Industrial Automation will continue to include the smart energy, thermal solutions, and process measurement and control businesses, currently included in the Honeywell Process Solutions business, Sensing and Safety Technologies, Warehouse and Workflow Solutions, and Productivity Solutions and Services. Following the realignment, the Company’s four reportable business segments will be Aerospace Technologies, Building Automation, Process Automation and Technology, and Industrial Automation. Other operations will continue to be presented in Corporate and All Other, which is separately reported but is not a reportable business segment. In addition to the realignment, also beginning in 2026, the Company will report its disaggregation of revenue within its Building Automation, Process Automation and Technology, and Industrial Automation segments based on the business models of Products, Projects, Solutions, and Aftermarket. The Company expects to report its financial performance based on this realignment effective with the first quarter of 2026 and will have no impact on the Company's historical consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, effective October 30, 2025, the Company completed the spin-off of its Advanced Materials business into an independent, publicly traded company, Solstice Advanced Materials (NASDAQ: SOLS). The Advanced Materials business had historically been part of the Energy and Sustainability Systems reportable segment. In connection with the spin-off, the Advanced Materials business will be reported as discontinued operations effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2025, and retrospectively for all comparative periods reported. Corporate expenses historically allocated to Advanced Materials and not eligible to be part of discontinued operations are now included in Corporate and All Other. Net Sales, Operating Income, and Operating Cash Flows from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, were approximately $3.8 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively. Attached as Exhibit 99.1 is a supplemental schedule containing unaudited segment information for the three months ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2025, three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, recast on the basis of the proposed realignment of the business segments expected to be effective with the quarter ending March 31, 2026 and the presentation of the Advanced Materials business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2025. To provide supplemental historical information on a basis consistent with its announced new reporting structure and the spin-off of Advanced Materials, the Company has also furnished in the attached Exhibit 99.1 certain non-GAAP supplemental historical business segment information to conform to the announced new reporting structure and retrospective impacts of the Advanced Materials business which will be reported as discontinued operations. The supplemental unaudited historical business segment information contained in Exhibit 99.1 does not represent a restatement or reissuance of previously issued financial statements. The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, and September 30, 2025.

(the “ Company ”) announced, in connection with the anticipated spin-off (the “ Spin-Off ”) of the Company’s Advanced Materials business into an independent, publicly traded company named “Solstice Advanced Materials Inc.” (“ Solstice ”), that its board of directors has approved a record date of October 17, 2025 (the “ Record Date ”) for the pro rata distribution (the “ Distribution ”) of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Solstice to the holders of Company common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date (the “ Eligible Holders ”).

Item 8.01 Other Events On September 30, 2025, Solstice issued 5.625% Senior Notes due 2033 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion (the “ Notes ”), issued pursuant to an indenture dated September 30, 2025 among Solstice, the guarantors named therein, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the “ Indenture ”). The Notes were sold in private placements to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per year. The proceeds from the Notes offering will be held in escrow until satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Spin-Off and certain other escrow release conditions. If such conditions are not met by March 31, 2026, the Notes will be redeemed at 100% of principal plus accrued interest. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Solstice, guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of its domestic subsidiaries and, from and after the escrow release date, will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of Solstice’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantees Solstice’s senior credit facilities. Solstice will pay interest on the Notes on March 31 and September 30 of each year. The first such payment will be made on March 31, 2026. The Notes will mature on September 30, 2033. Solstice may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September 30, 2028 at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. Solstice may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on or prior to September 30, 2028 in an amount equal to the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture. Prior to September 30, 2028, Solstice may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium set forth in the Indenture. Upon certain events constituting a change of control under the Indenture, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require Solstice to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to (but not including) the date of purchase. The Indenture, among other things, limits Solstice’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted payments; make investments; consummate certain asset sales; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; grant or assume certain liens; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of Solstice’s assets. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may cause the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become, or to be declared, due and payable. Events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), include, among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of other covenants or agreements in the Indenture, failure to pay certain other indebtedness, failure to pay certain final judgments, failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.

(“Resideo”) from Honeywell International Inc. (the “Company”), the Company entered into certain agreements with Resideo, including an Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, dated October 14, 2018, between New HAPI Inc. (as subsequently assigned to Resideo Intermediate Holding Inc. (“RIH”)) and the Company (the “Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement”), to which relevant Resideo subsidiaries have become parties. Pursuant to the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, RIH has an obligation to make cash payments to the Company in amounts equal to 90% of payments, which include amounts billed (“payments”), with respect to certain environmental claims, remediation and, to the extent arising after the Spin-Off, hazardous exposure or toxic tort claims, in each case, including consequential damages (the “liabilities”) in respect of specified properties contaminated through historical business operations, including the legal and other costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less 90% of the Company’s net insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and less 90% of the net proceeds received by the Company in connection with (i) affirmative claims relating to such liabilities, (ii) contributions by other parties relating to such liabilities and (iii) certain property sales (the “recoveries”). The amount payable by RIH in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a cap of $140 million (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum). The Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement was intended to remain in effect until the earlier of: (1) December 31, 2043; or (2) December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual indemnification obligation (including in respect of deferred payment amounts) has been less than $25 million. On July 30, 2025, the Company, Resideo, RIH and certain guarantor parties thereto entered into a termination agreement (the “Agreement”) for the accelerated monetization of the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is expected to occur effective no later than August 29, 2025 (the “Closing”), which date may be extended by Honeywell to October 30, 2025, if the termination has not occurred and the Agreement has not otherwise been terminated by August 29, 2025. Under the Agreement, at the Closing, RIH has agreed to pay the Company a one-time cash payment of $1.59 billion (the “Payment”), in lieu of all future payments to which the Company is entitled pursuant to the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement. Additionally, on July 29, 2025, Resideo paid the Quarterly Payment of $35,000,000 to be paid pursuant to Section 2.3(c) of the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement in connection with the Fiscal Quarter ending September 30, 2025. From signing until Closing (or termination of the Agreement), any amounts that would otherwise be due under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement are suspended and tolled, and if the Closing occurs, these tolled amounts are not payable. However, if the Agreement is terminated, any such tolled amounts become due with 5% interest per annum. Under the Agreement, Resideo and RIH represent and warrant that they have received financing commitments to secure financing sufficient, together with available cash on hand, to fund the Payment and that no material defaults exist under such financing arrangements. The obligations of Resideo and RIH under the Agreement are not conditioned on such financing being obtained. If the Closing does not occur by August 29, 2025 and the Agreement is terminated by Honeywell thereafter, or if the Closing does not occur by October 30, 2025 and the Agreement is terminated by Resideo thereafter, in each case when the financing to be received by Resideo has not yet been received, Resideo is required to pay the Company a fee of $100 million as liquidated damages and the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement and all guarantees entered into pursuant to the terms thereof will remain in effect.

As previously disclosed and as reflected in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, effective the first quarter of 2024, the Company realigned its business units by forming two new business segments: Industrial Automation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions.

Energy and Sustainability Solutions includes UOP and Advanced Materials, which were previously included in Performance Materials and Technologies. Further, as part of the realignment, the Company renamed its Aerospace and Honeywell Building Technologies reportable business segments to Aerospace Technologies and Building Automation, respectively. Following this realignment, the Company’s reportable business segments are: Aerospace Technologies, Building Automation, Industrial Automation, and Energy and Sustainability Solutions.

Under the terms of the group annuity contracts, the plans initially retained the obligation for paying the pension benefits to the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance companies reimbursed the plans as those benefits were paid. The group annuity contracts also provided the Company the option to transfer the defined benefit pension obligations to the insurance companies at its discretion. Upon completion of the conversions, the insurance companies legally assumed the pension obligations and will begin paying and administering the retirement benefits for approximately 9,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. There will be no change to the nature, amount, or timing of benefit payments as a result of the conversions. In connection with the transactions, the Company expects to recognize a non-cash, non-operating pretax settlement charge of approximately $480 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, which reflects the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses for the affected plan that were included in stockholders’ equity. The estimated charge was not included in the Company’s prior 2025 financial outlook released on October 21, 2025. Forward Looking Statements This current report on 8-K contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the expected non-cash settlement charge, and are based on Lockheed Martin’s current expectations and assumptions. The words “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan,” “outlook,” “scheduled,” “forecast” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially due to factors such as: the amount of the expected settlement charge, the accuracy of the Company’s estimates and projections; timing and estimates regarding pension funding and movements of interest rates; other changes that may affect pension plan assumptions and actual returns on pension plan assets, stockholders’ equity, the level of the FAS/CAS adjustment and actual returns on pension plan assets; cash funding requirements and additional pension risk transfers and associated settlement charges; and the impact of pension related legislation. These are only some of the factors that may affect the forward-looking statements contained in this current report on Form 8-K. For a discussion identifying additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) including, but not limited to, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The Company’s filings may be accessed through the Investor Relations page of its website, www.lockheedmartin.com/investor, or through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. Except where required by applicable law, the Company expressly disclaims a duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 8-K to reflect subsequent events, changed circumstances, changes in expectations, or the estimates and assumptions associated with them. The forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by the federal securities laws."

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement. On December 5, 2025, Lockheed Martin Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a new 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the “364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement”), among the Company, as borrower, the lenders listed therein (the “Lenders”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Citibank, N.A., Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as documentation agents, and Bank of America, N.A. (“BofA”), as administrative agent. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement consists of a $3.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement is available for any lawful corporate purposes of the Company, including supporting commercial paper borrowings. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement matures on December 4, 2026, however, the Company may elect to have the entire principal balance of borrowings then outstanding continued as non-revolving term loans for a period of one additional year, payable on December 4, 2027. Borrowings under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement are unsecured and bear interest at rates, based, at the Company’s option, on (w) the “Base Rate” of interest in effect, (x) “Term SOFR,” which is a periodic fixed rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”) with a term equivalent to the interest period for such borrowing, plus the “Term SOFR Margin,” (y) “Daily Simple SOFR,” which is a daily fluctuating rate based on SOFR, plus the “Term SOFR Margin,” or (z) a rate determined by a competitive bid process with a margin over or under the applicable Term SOFR or at an absolute rate. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) BofA’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1.00%. The “Term SOFR Margin” ranges from 0.585% to 1.085% per annum based upon the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt securities credit ratings (the “Credit Ratings”). A facility fee accrues and is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 0.04% (based upon the Company’s Credit Ratings) on the aggregate commitments under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants restricting the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and the Company’s ability to merge or consolidate with another entity. The Company may terminate, in whole or in part, the unused portion of the total commitments under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. Once terminated, a commitment may not be reinstated. The obligation of the Company to pay amounts outstanding under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” as defined in the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include (1) the Company’s failure to pay when due the principal of, or within 5 days when due, the facility fee or the interest on borrowings under the credit facility, (2) the Company’s failure to comply with certain covenants contained in the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (after expiration of any applicable grace periods), (3) any representation or warranty of the Company in the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement proving to be incorrect in any material respect when made, (4) the Company’s failure to pay, or the acceleration of, any Material Debt (as defined in the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement), (5) the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or a Material Subsidiary (as defined in the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement), (6) an unsatisfied judgment in excess of $300 million against the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement), or (7) a change in control of the Company. The foregoing summary of the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. No borrowings under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement were made at closing. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, one or more of the Lenders, or their affiliates, have or may have various relationships with the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries involving the provision of a variety of financial services, including cash management, commercial banking, investment banking, trust or agency, foreign exchange, advisory or other financial services, for which they received, or will receive, customary fees and expenses."

Update on F-35 Technology Refresh 3 The U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program Office (the “JPO”) and the Company have reached an agreement for the acceptance and delivery of Technology Refresh 3 (“TR-3”) enabled aircraft with robust combat training capability. As part of the agreement, the JPO will withhold a portion of final aircraft delivery payments from the Company until TR-3 combat capability is qualified and delivered. Additionally, the Company is making significant investments in development labs and digital infrastructure that benefit the F-35 enterprise’s speed and agility in fielding capabilities to the most advanced and connected fighter jet. The substance of this agreement is consistent with the expectations the Company had at the time it issued its full-year 2024 guidance in connection with its second quarter 2024 earnings announcement. Forward-Looking Statements The statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions, including statements about the payment terms and the phased approach to delivery of TR-3 capabilities, and investments in, and the impact of, development labs and digital infrastructure for the F-35 program. Actual results may differ materially due to factors such as: executing future flight tests and integrating findings resulting from aircraft testing and operations; the performance of the Company and its suppliers, including challenges relating to the delivery of hardware and software development; risks related to the development, production, sustainment, performance, schedule, cost and requirements of the F-35 program; planned production rates and orders; compliance with stringent performance and reliability standards; materials availability, including government furnished equipment; the timing of contract awards or delays in contract definitization as well as the timing and customer acceptance of product deliveries and performance milestones; performance and financial viability of key suppliers, teammates, joint ventures, joint venture partners, subcontractors and customers; budget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the impact of continuing resolution funding mechanisms and the debt ceiling and the potential for government shutdowns and changing funding and acquisition priorities; government actions that prevent the sale or delivery of the Company’s products; and changes in foreign national priorities and foreign government budgets and planned orders. For a discussion identifying additional important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) including ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

Other Events. ​ On February 11, 2026 (the Grant Date), the Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee of the Citigroup Inc. (Citi) Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) approved incentive compensation awards for 2025 performance to Citi’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jane Fraser. The Compensation Committee’s 2025 incentive compensation determination for Ms. Fraser reflects her work to meaningfully strengthen Citi’s performance throughout 2025, her strategic vision and her leadership in executing that vision, and the continued execution of the bold choices she has made to position the firm for further growth. Under her leadership in 2025, each of Citi’s five businesses delivered positive operating leverage and record revenue, the firm’s stock price performance led all industry peers over the past one- and three-calendar-year periods, and Citi has advanced its transformation, with more than 80% of our programs at or near Citi’s target state. Additional achievements that factored into the determination include: ● The record 2025 revenues reported by each of Citi’s five core businesses— Services , Markets , Banking , Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking ( USPB ) —reflect returns that improved by between 250 and approximately 800 basis points. ● The firm’s 2025 net income was up 13% and revenues were up 6%, in each case from 2024. Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.2% and remains above its regulatory capital requirement. Citi also returned over $17.5 billion to common stockholders in 2025 through stock repurchases and dividends. ● During 2025, Citi made significant progress concerning regulatory compliance. This includes the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s termination of its July 2024 amendment to Citibank’s 2020 Consent Order. ● Citi made continued improvements in the transformation of our risk and control environment, including nearing the completion of a five-year process to design and implement a new framework for assessing how managers control risks; substantially upgrading how we ensure compliance with regulatory capital requirements and business planning forecasting; and making further advancements in the firm’s data management. ● During 2025, Citi reached significant milestones in terms of our simplification as we approach the end of our international divestitures. We signed an agreement to sell our consumer business in Poland, and we received internal approvals to sell our remaining institutional operations in Russia. We also negotiated the sale of a 25% stake of Banamex to one of Mexico’s most prominent investors, and closed the transaction just three months after announcing it. ● The incorporation of Citi’s Retail Banking business into Wealth in order to realize synergies between those two lines of business, and to establish the U.S. Consumer Cards business as one of Citi’s five core businesses. ● Competitive market levels of pay for CEOs of peer institutions, which the Compensation Committee considers important for retention and motivational purposes. ​ ​ 2 For 2025, the Compensation Committee determined that Ms. Fraser’s compensation is $42 million, consisting of a flat base salary of $1.5 million and a total incentive award of $40.5 million as indicated in the following table. ​ ​ CEO Compensation for 2025 ​ Element Form Amount Base Salary Cash $1.5 million Cash Incentive Cash (15% of total incentive award) $6.075 million Deferred Incentive Deferred Stock (35% of total incentive award) Vests ratably over 4 years subject to performance conditions $14.175 million Performance Share Units (PSUs) (50% of total incentive award) Vests based on equally weighted tangible book value per share over 3 years and weighted average return on tangible common equity $20.25 million Total ​ $42 million ​ Consistent with prior years, the number of shares of deferred stock granted for 2025 was determined by dividing the nominal amount awarded in deferred stock by the average of the closing prices of Citi common stock on the five business days immediately preceding the Grant Date ($120.356). The target number of PSUs was also determined by dividing the nominal amount awarded as PSUs by the same five-day average price. Additional information regarding Citi’s incentive compensation programs, including an explanation of the special award granted to Ms. Fraser in October 2025 in recognition of her performance during her tenure as CEO, and of the material elements of the compensation for 2025 awarded to Ms. Fraser and the other named executive officers, will be presented in Citi’s 2026 Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2026. ​"

On July 1, 2025, Citigroup Inc. (Citi) announced that it has completed the Federal Reserve Board’s 2025 annual supervisory stress test process. Citi’s indicative Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement is 3.6%, 50 bps down from the current 4.1%, and Citi's preliminary Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio regulatory requirement will be 11.6%, 50 bps down from the current 12.1%. As of March 31, 2025, Citi's Standardized CET1 capital ratio was 13.4%, which was 130 basis points above the regulatory requirement of 12.1%. The Federal Reserve Board will provide Citi with its final SCB requirement later this quarter. Citi’s planned capital actions include an increase of Citi's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.56 to $0.60 per share, subject to quarterly approval by Citi's Board of Directors, starting in the third quarter of 2025. As previously announced, Citi commenced a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program in January 2025, of which $3.75 billion has been repurchased year-to-date. Certain statements in this release are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future results or occurrences. Citi’s final Stress Capital Buffer requirement and actual capital levels and capital actions (including common stock dividends and repurchases) may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors. These factors include, among others: macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties; the potential outcomes of the extensive regulatory proceedings, examinations, consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries to which Citi is or may be subject; ongoing regulatory uncertainties and changes, including changes in regulatory capital requirements, interpretations or rules; and the precautionary statements included in this report. These factors also consist of those contained in Citi's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation the ""Risk Factors"" section of Citi's 2024 Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citi speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. ​ ​ 2 ​"

Special CEO Equity Award On July 29, 2025, the independent members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Wells Fargo & Company (the “Company”), consistent with the recommendation of the Human Resources Committee of the Board (the “HRC”), awarded Chief Executive Officer and President Charles W. Scharf a one-time equity award (the “Award”), consisting of Restricted Share Rights (“RSRs”) with a grant date value of approximately $30 million and 1.046 million Stock Options (“Options”). Both the RSRs and Options will vest (and become exercisable for Options) on a pro-rata basis following the fourth, fifth, and sixth anniversaries of the grant date. If Mr. Scharf resigns or retires from the Company, unvested portions of the Award will be forfeited. The Award reflects the Board’s desire to retain Mr. Scharf in his role and to acknowledge his successful leadership of the Company, in particular by: • promoting the long-term retention of Mr. Scharf as the Company ’ s CEO • recognizing Mr. Scharf’s role in building a strong executive team and supporting his continued leadership of the team in driving future growth • recognizing Mr. Scharf’s leadership in driving significant progress, including: ◦ creating significant shareholder value and positioning the Company for future success ◦ continuing to build out a sustainable risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a company of our size and complexity ◦ reaching key regulatory milestones, resulting in 13 consent orders terminating during his tenure and including the Federal Reserve announcing in June 2025 the termination of the limits on growth in total assets that had been imposed in 2018 ◦ delivering a strong financial performance, while making strategic investments in driving growth of the Company ’ s core businesses • maintaining our CEO’s compensation relative to peer financial institutions, including the CEOs of our Labor Market Peer Group The Award design is intended to promote long-term shareholder value creation as the value of the RSRs will fluctuate with the Company’s stock price and the Options will only have value to the extent the Company’s stock price appreciates over the vesting period. The entire Award will be subject to the Company’s Clawback and Forfeiture Policy as well as our Stock Ownership Policy, under which Mr. Scharf must, for the duration of his employment and one year after his departure, retain at least 50% of the net vested shares from Company stock-based awards. The foregoing summary of the Award is qualified in all respects by reference to the text of the award agreements that govern the Award, forms of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. 2 2025 Named Executive Officer Compensation Program In connection with a comprehensive evaluation of our executive compensation program earlier this year, the HRC determined not to maintain a target total compensation structure for our named executive officers (“NEOs”) effective as of the 2025 performance year. The HRC will continue to determine incentive compensation for each NEO, including the CEO, using a holistic performance assessment that evaluates NEO performance based on individual and Company performance, as well as line of business performance, where applicable, relative to established financial and non-financial performance criteria. This change further aligns the Company’s executive compensation program with those of the Company’s most comparable peers. The HRC will continue to award incentive compensation through a combination of cash and equity, with a significant majority deferred through performance share awards and RSRs that include additional performance and vesting criteria. Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. On July 29, 2025, the Board approved and adopted the Company’s By-Laws (as amended and restated, the “By-Laws”), effective immediately. Among other things, the amendments remove the requirement that the Chairman of the Board be an independent director. The Board also amended the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) to, among other things, require a Lead Independent Director if the Chairman of the Board is not independent. Consistent with this change, the independent directors of the Board intend to appoint Mr. Scharf as Chairman of the Board, and to appoint a Lead Independent Director of the Board. Additionally, the amendments to the By-Laws update certain procedural and disclosure requirements related to director nominations and/or other business proposals by shareholders, including by: • tailoring information requirements to focus on the actual proposing shareholders • removing requirements to disclose certain commercial interests relating to the Company and its principal competitors • clarifying the purpose of any additional disclosure requirements as may be reasonably requested by the Company for a proposed nominee • clarifying certain disclosure requirements regarding the director nominee questionnaire and representations The amendments also: (i) update language permitting the use of proxies to align more closely with the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law and market practice; (ii) remove unnecessary detail regarding geographic locations referenced therein; and (iii) incorporate various other technical, clarifying and conforming changes, including certain changes to defined terms to improve readability. The foregoing summary of the By-Laws is qualified in all respects by reference to the text of the By-Laws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. On July 31, 2025, the Company issued a press release announcing the Award and the Board’s intent to change its leadership structure.

(e) As previously disclosed in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2025, the board of directors (the “ Board ”) of Tesla, Inc., a Texas corporation (the “ Company ”) established a special committee (the “ Special Committee ”) to consider certain compensation matters involving Elon Musk, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Special Committee is comprised of disinterested directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. On August 3, 2025, the Company approved an award of 96 million shares of restricted stock (the “ 2025 CEO Interim Award ”) to Mr. Musk under the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ 2019 Plan ”). The shares underlying the 2025 CEO Interim Award will be issued upon termination or expiration of the waiting period or periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “ HSR Act ”). The 2025 CEO Interim Award was recommended by the Special Committee on August 1, 2025, and approved by the Board, with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing, on August 3, 2025. Summary of the 2025 CEO Interim Award The 2025 CEO Interim Award consists of the following key terms: · Number of Shares : 96 million shares of common stock. · Vesting Schedule : The 2025 CEO Interim Award will vest upon the second anniversary of August 3, 2025 (the “ Date of Grant ”), subject to Mr. Musk remaining in continuous service as CEO or as an executive officer responsible for product development or operations (as approved by the Board’s disinterested directors) through such second anniversary (“ Eligible Service ”). · Early Forfeiture : The 2025 CEO Interim Award will be immediately forfeited and returned to the Company if, prior to vesting, there is a final, non-appealable judgment, order or decision of the Delaware courts with respect to the action captioned Tornetta v. Elon Musk et al., C.A. No. 2018-0408-KSJM (Del. Ch.), or any pending or future appeal, including In re Tesla, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Nos. 10, 2025, 11, 2025 (Del.) (a “ Tornetta Decision Event ”) that results in Mr. Musk becoming able to exercise in full the performance-based stock option award he was granted in January 2018 (the “ 2018 CEO Award ”). · Purchase Price : Mr. Musk must pay the Company $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests (the “ Purchase Price ”), which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 CEO Award. · Holding Period : Mr. Musk will not sell, transfer or dispose of the shares covered by the 2025 CEO Interim Award until after the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant, except (i) as required to satisfy taxes due in respect to vesting of the 2025 CEO Interim Award, pay the Purchase Price or both, (ii) in transactions that involve merely a change of form in which Mr. Musk owns the shares covered by the 2025 CEO Interim Award or (iii) as may be permitted by the disinterested directors of the Board acting as administrator, consistent with the Company’s internal policies (with any sales for the purposes described in (i) and (ii) to be conducted through an orderly disposition in coordination with the Company). · No Double Dip : If there is a Tornetta Decision Event that results in Mr. Musk becoming able to exercise options covered by the 2018 CEO Award, but does not result in Early Forfeiture, then: (i) if the Tornetta Decision Event occurs prior to vesting, shares covered by the 2025 CEO Interim Award will be reduced to the extent that (a) the sum of the 2025 CEO Interim Award shares and any amount of options exercisable under the 2018 CEO Award exceeds (b) the total number of options subject to the 2018 CEO Award in full (the “ Excess Amount ”); and (ii) if the Tornetta Decision Event occurs after vesting, Mr. Musk will return or otherwise repay the Company for shares issued under the 2025 CEO Interim Award equal to the Excess Amount and the Company will return or otherwise repay the Purchase Price. Alternatively, rather than returning or repaying as contemplated in clause (ii), Mr. Musk may elect to forfeit the number of options underlying the 2018 CEO Award equal to the Excess Amount. · Limited Pledging : Solely in order to satisfy payment of the Purchase Price and taxes due in respect of the vesting of the 2025 CEO Interim Award, Mr. Musk may pledge any shares he beneficially owns (including, without limitation, the 2025 CEO Interim Award and the 2018 CEO Award). · Additional Vesting Provisions : The 2025 CEO Interim Award will vest on an accelerated basis prior to the second anniversary of the Date of Grant if Mr. Musk is in continued Eligible Service upon a Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Plan) or his death. The foregoing summary of the terms of the 2025 CEO Interim Award does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to both the 2019 Plan, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.8 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on January 31, 2025, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 30, 2025, and the restricted stock award agreement pursuant to which the 2025 CEO Interim Award was granted (the “ Award Agreement ”), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. Accounting Consequences of the 2025 CEO Interim Award The Company expects to account for the 2025 CEO Interim Award as a grant of restricted stock with a performance condition in accordance with ASC Topic 718, which for purposes of the 2025 CEO Interim Award is based upon the probability of certain conditions being met. Restricted stock with a performance condition is accounted for by recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period, based on the accounting grant-date fair value, but only if and when the vesting of the award becomes probable. For accounting purposes, the accounting grant-date fair value of the 2025 CEO Interim Award will be determined on the date that the shares of restricted stock are delivered to Mr. Musk, which will be subject to the termination or expiration of the waiting period or periods under the HSR Act as described above. The accounting grant-date fair value is expected to be based upon the prevailing market price of the Company’s common stock on such date less the Purchase Price, adjusted to take into account an illiquidity discount due to the required holding period. The expense is adjusted for changes to the estimated likelihood of vesting based on the performance condition. As of the date of this report, the Company expects that the performance condition of the 2025 CEO Interim Award will not be deemed to be probable of being met. As a result, the Company currently expects that it will not recognize a compensation expense upon the issuance of the award. However, the Company will reassess the probability of the performance condition being met at least quarterly. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance condition will be met, at that date, the Company will record a cumulative catch-up expense based on the accounting grant-date fair value of the award (which reflects an illiquidity discount due to transfer and holding restrictions), ratably for the amount of time that has passed since the beginning of the two-year requisite service period and amounting to the remaining portion of the accounting grant-date fair value over the two-year requisite service period. If the performance condition remains not probable as of the end of the two-year requisite service period, such that the 2025 CEO Interim Award remains subject to forfeiture or cancellation, the Company may not recognize the compensation expense at such time. If, at any time following the two-year vesting period, the performance condition becomes probable, the Company will be required to recognize the related compensation expense at that time. The Company is unable to predict whether a compensation expense will be recognized at any time during the two-year requisite service period, or thereafter. For illustrative purposes only, if the approvals had been obtained on August 1, 2025, based on the closing stock price on such date, the accounting grant-date fair value of the 2025 CEO Interim Award would have been approximately $23.7 billion. This amount is based on such assumptions and is provided only for illustrative purposes. It does not reflect the accounting grant-date fair value of the 2025 CEO Interim Award that will be calculated in the future and disclosed in the Company’s future financial statements, nor is it indicative of the timing of recognizing any compensation expenses. - 2 - Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. The Company made a post on X containing a letter to shareholders from Robyn Denholm, Chair of Tesla's Board of Directors, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a Director of Tesla’s Board, the members of the Special Committee, announcing the grant of the 2025 CEO Interim Award on August 4, 2025.

Unless earlier converted, each outstanding share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on the second business day immediately following the last trading day of the Final Averaging Period (as defined below) into between 499.8126 and 624.7657 shares of Common Stock (and, correspondingly, each Depositary Share will automatically convert into between 0.2499 and 0.3124 shares of Common Stock), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion will be determined based on the average volume-weighted average price of a share of Common Stock over the 20 consecutive trading-day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day prior to January 15, 2029 (the “Final Averaging Period”). Other than during a fundamental change conversion period (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), at any time prior to the mandatory conversion settlement date, a holder of 2,000 Depositary Shares may cause the Depositary to convert one share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, on such holder’s behalf, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the minimum conversion rate of 499.8126, subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. In addition, in the event of Oracle’s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, each holder of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation preference in the amount of $100,000 per share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid dividends on the shares to, but excluding, the date fixed for liquidation, winding-up or dissolution to be paid out of Oracle’s assets available for distribution to its stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities owed to Oracle’s creditors and holders of any senior stock and before any payment or distribution is made to holders of junior stock, including the Common Stock.

Upon delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Sales Agents will use reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations, and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to sell the Shares from time to time based upon Oracle’s instructions for the sales, including any price, time or size limits specified by Oracle.

Oracle is not obligated to sell any Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement. The Equity Distribution Agreement may be terminated for any reason by Oracle at any time by giving written notice to the Sales Agents or by any Sales Agent at any time, with respect to such Sales Agent only, by giving written notice to Oracle.

On February 11, 2026, Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) reported its results of operations for its fiscal second quarter 2026 ended January 24, 2026. A copy of the press release issued by Cisco concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Cisco, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibit includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Cisco’s management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies (such as legal and indemnification settlements and the supplier component remediation amounts), gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. Cisco’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. As described above, Cisco excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense . These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee restricted stock and restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase rights, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. Cisco excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Cisco believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets . Cisco incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. Such intangible assets may include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, capitalized in process research and development and goodwill. Cisco excludes these items because Cisco does not believe these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from Cisco's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco's business. Acquisition-related/divestiture costs . In connection with its business combinations, Cisco incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time Cisco enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. Cisco may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. Cisco excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco's business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings . Cisco from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. Cisco excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements and other contingencies . Cisco from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements and other contingencies. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Gains and losses on investments . Cisco excludes gains and losses on our marketable equity investments and our investments in privately held companies, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing . This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters . Cisco may incur tax charges or benefits that are (i) related to prior periods or (ii) not reflective of its ongoing provision for income taxes. These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods."

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On November 12, 2025, Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) reported its results of operations for its fiscal first quarter 2026 ended October 25, 2025. A copy of the press release issued by Cisco concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Cisco, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibit includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Cisco’s management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies (such as legal and indemnification settlements and the supplier component remediation amounts), gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. Cisco’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. As described above, Cisco excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee restricted stock and restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase rights, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. Cisco excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Cisco believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets . Cisco incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. Such intangible assets may include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, capitalized in process research and development and goodwill. Cisco excludes these items because Cisco does not believe these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from Cisco’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco’s business. Acquisition-related/divestiture costs . In connection with its business combinations, Cisco incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time Cisco enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. Cisco may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. Cisco excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco’s business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings . Cisco from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. Cisco excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements and other contingencies . Cisco from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements and other contingencies. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Gains and losses on investments. Cisco excludes gains and losses on our marketable equity investments and our investments in privately held companies, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing . This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. Cisco may incur tax charges or benefits that are (i) related to prior periods or (ii) not reflective of its ongoing provision for income taxes. These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods."

In past periods, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus.

These charges included non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees (unrelated to ordinary compensation expenses), potential future litigation and other contingencies, and other exit related costs, among others. Cisco excluded these charges because it believed they were not normal and recurring with respect to ongoing business and operating results.

Upon his appointment, pursuant to the Board’s equity grant policy for non-employee directors, Mr. Weil automatically received a fully vested initial non-employee director equity award under Cisco’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan with a grant date fair value equal to a pro rata portion of $245,000 based on the portion of the year of his board service. Non-employee directors may elect to defer receipt of the equity award such that the award would be settled in shares after the non-employee director leaves the Board. Non-employee directors are also eligible to participate in Cisco’s charitable matching gifts program (for calendar year 2025, the maximum match amount is $25,000 for Cisco's non-employee directors). In connection with his appointment, Mr. Weil has entered into Cisco’s standard form of Indemnity Agreement with Cisco which provides for indemnification of an indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law. The foregoing description of the Indemnity Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the form of Indemnity Agreement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 25, 2021 as Exhibit 10.1 to Cisco’s Current Report on Form 8-K."

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On February 12, 2025, Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) reported its results of operations for its fiscal second quarter 2025 ended January 25, 2025. A copy of the press release issued by Cisco concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Cisco, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibit includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Cisco’s management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies (such as legal and indemnification settlements and the supplier component remediation amounts), Russia-Ukraine war costs, gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. Cisco’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. As described above, Cisco excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee restricted stock and restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase rights, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. Cisco excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Cisco believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets . Cisco incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. Such intangible assets may include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, capitalized in process research and development and goodwill. Cisco excludes these items because Cisco does not believe these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from Cisco’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco’s business. Acquisition-related/divestiture costs . In connection with its business combinations, Cisco incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time Cisco enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. Cisco may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. Cisco excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco’s business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings . Cisco from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. Cisco excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements and other contingencies . Cisco from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements and other contingencies. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Russia-Ukraine war costs . In past periods, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus. Cisco began an orderly wind-down and exit of its business in Russia and Belarus. Cisco had incurred certain non-recurring charges related to this exit plan. These charges included non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees (unrelated to ordinary compensation expenses), potential future litigation and other contingencies, and other exit related costs, among others. Cisco excluded these charges because it believed they were not normal and recurring with respect to ongoing business and operating results. These excluded amounts did not include any impacts to revenue. Gains and losses on investments. Cisco excludes gains and losses on our marketable equity investments and our investments in privately held companies, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing . This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. Cisco may incur tax charges or benefits that are (i) related to prior periods or (ii) not reflective of its ongoing provision for income taxes. These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods."

These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, Russia-Ukraine war costs, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods. Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities On August 14, 2024, Cisco announced a restructuring plan to allow it to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in its business. This restructuring plan is expected to impact approximately 7 percent of Cisco’s global workforce. Cisco currently estimates that it will recognize pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of up to $1 billion consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. These charges are primarily cash-based. Cisco expects to recognize approximately $700 million to $800 million of these charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with the remaining amount expected to be recognized during the rest of fiscal 2025. The foregoing contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include the size and scope of the restructuring, and the approximate amount and expected timing of the related charges. Statements regarding future events are based on Cisco’s current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated risks related to the completion of the restructuring in the manner anticipated by Cisco. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: Cisco’s ability to achieve the benefits of the announced restructuring and possible changes in the size and timing of the related charges. For information regarding other factors that could cause Cisco’s results to vary from expectations, please see the “Risk Factors” section of Cisco’s periodic report filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. Cisco undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements."

In connection with her appointment, the Board determined that Ms. Singh-Bushell is “independent” under the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The Board has also appointed Ms. Singh-Bushell to serve as a member of both the Audit Committee and the Environmental, Social, and Public Policy Committee (the ""Public Policy Committee"") of the Board. In connection with her service as a director, Ms. Singh-Bushell will receive Cisco’s standard non-employee director cash and equity compensation. Ms. Singh-Bushell will receive a pro rata portion of the $105,000 annual cash retainer, paid quarterly in arrears, for her service through the remaining portion of the year ending at Cisco's 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the ""2024 Annual Meeting""). Ms. Singh-Bushell will also receive a pro rata portion of each of the Audit Committee and Public Policy Committee member annual cash retainer fees, paid quarterly in arrears, for service on such committees through the remaining portion of the year ending at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Non-employee directors may instead elect to receive the annual cash retainer, committee cash retainer fees or other cash fees in fully vested shares of Cisco common stock, fully vested deferred stock units that would be settled in shares after the non-employee director leaves the Board, or a deferred cash payment under the Cisco Systems, Inc.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On May 15, 2024, Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) reported its results of operations for its fiscal third quarter 2024 ended April 27, 2024. A copy of the press release issued by Cisco concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Cisco, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibit includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Cisco’s management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies (such as legal and indemnification settlements and the supplier component remediation amounts), Russia-Ukraine war costs, gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. Cisco’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. As described above, Cisco excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee restricted stock and restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase rights, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. Cisco excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Cisco believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets . Cisco incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. Such intangible assets may include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, capitalized in process research and development and goodwill. Cisco excludes these items because Cisco does not believe these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from Cisco’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco’s business. Acquisition-related/divestiture costs . In connection with its business combinations, Cisco incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time Cisco enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. Cisco may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. Cisco excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of Cisco’s business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings . Cisco from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. Cisco excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements and other contingencies . Cisco from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements and other contingencies. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Russia-Ukraine War Costs . In March 2022, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future. Cisco has begun an orderly wind-down and exit of its business in Russia and Belarus. Cisco has and may incur certain non-recurring charges related to this exit plan. These charges include non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees (unrelated to ordinary compensation expenses), potential future litigation and other contingencies, and other exit related costs, among others. Cisco excludes these charges because it believes they are not normal and recurring with respect to ongoing business and operating results. These excluded amounts do not include any impacts to revenue. Gains and losses on investments. Cisco excludes gains and losses on our marketable equity investments and our investments in privately held companies, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing . This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. Cisco may incur tax charges or benefits that are (i) related to prior periods or (ii) not reflective of its ongoing provision for income taxes. These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation, court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, Russia-Ukraine war costs, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods. Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. Appointment of Certain Officer; Departure of Certain Officer Effective May 15, 2024, as part of organizational changes with respect to Cisco’s executive leadership team, Cisco appointed Gary Steele as President, Go-to-Market.

Prior to joining Splunk, Mr. Steele served as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of Proofpoint, Inc. (“Proofpoint”), from 2002 to 2022, and served as the Chair of the board of directors of Proofpoint from 2018 to 2021. From 1997 to 2002, Mr. Steele served as Chief Executive Officer of Portera Systems Inc. (“Portera”). Before Portera, Mr. Steele served as the Vice President and General Manager of the Middleware and Data Warehousing Product Group at Sybase, Inc. Mr. Steele also served in business development, marketing, and engineering roles at Sun Microsystems, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company. Since 2018, Mr. Steele has served as a member of the board of directors of Upwork Inc. Mr. Steele previously served as a member of the board of directors of Vonage Holdings Corp., from 2016 to 2021. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officer In connection with his appointment, on May 15, 2024, Mr. Steele entered into a letter agreement with Cisco (the “Letter Agreement”), providing for an annual base salary of $1 million; the ability to participate in Cisco’s Executive Incentive Plan following Mr. Steele’s onboarding with Cisco, which is currently expected to occur in the fourth quarter of Cisco’s fiscal year 2024, with a bonus target equal to 160% of his annual base salary (“Target Annual Bonus”); management’s recommendation to the Compensation and Management Development Committee of Cisco’s Board of Directors that Mr. Steele be approved for a fiscal year 2025 equity award with an approximate grant date fair value of $18 million and a transformational performance-based equity award for fiscal year 2025 with an approximate grant date fair value of $2.5 million; and Cisco’s payment or reimbursement of Mr. Steele’s reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with the Letter Agreement. The Letter Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between Mr. Steele and Cisco, except for the Retention Bonus (as defined below). The Letter Agreement further provides that Mr. Steele will remain entitled to the change in control severance protections under Mr. Steele’s employment agreement with Splunk, which provide that, upon a Good Leaver Termination during the period beginning on Mr. Steele’s start date and ending on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date (March 18, 2024) of Cisco’s acquisition of Splunk (the “Closing Date”), Mr. Steele will receive a lump sum cash amount equal to (a) the sum of (i) 24 months of Mr. Steele’s monthly annual salary plus (ii) two times 160% of Mr. Steele’s annual salary plus (iii) a pro-rated Target Annual Bonus (as defined in the Letter Agreement), less applicable deductions, as cash severance; and (b) the premiums required to continue Mr. Steele’s group health care coverage for a period of 18 months. A “Good Leaver Termination” occurs if (a) Cisco terminates Mr. Steele’s employment without “Cause” (as defined in the Letter Agreement); (b) Mr. Steele resigns with “Good Reason” (as defined in the Letter Agreement); (c) in the event of Mr. Steele’s death or “Permanent Disability” (as defined in the Letter Agreement); or (d) Mr. Steele voluntarily terminates his active employment effective following the first anniversary of the Closing Date (provided Mr. Steele provides at least 90 days written notice prior to ceasing active employment with Cisco). In connection with Cisco’s acquisition of Splunk, Mr. Steele was granted a cash retention bonus in the amount of $15 million (the “Retention Bonus”), which vests one-third on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date and then the remaining two-thirds in equal quarterly installments over the immediately following 24 months, subject to Mr. Steele’s continued employment with Cisco. In addition, in connection with Cisco’s acquisition of Splunk, Mr. Steele’s unvested equity awards in Splunk were converted to cash awards (the “Unvested Cash Awards”). The Unvested Cash Awards vest on the same vesting schedule as the corresponding Splunk equity award, subject to Mr. Steele’s continued employment with Cisco, provided that, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Unvested Cash Awards other than the award granted on February 27, 2024, will vest on March 18, 2025 or, if earlier, the date of Mr. Steele’s Good Leaver Termination. The foregoing description of the Letter Agreement and the Retention Bonus are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Letter Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, and the Retention Bonus agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to the Letter Agreement. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Steele has entered into a standard form of Indemnity Agreement with Cisco which provides for indemnification of an indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law.

As an alternative to the Cash Offer, each eligible holder of Alphawave Shares may elect, in respect of all (but not part) of their holding of Alphawave Shares, to receive, in exchange for each Alphawave Share, either (i) 0.01662 of a new share of Qualcomm common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Qualcomm Shares”) (“Alternative Offer 1”) or (ii) 0.00964 of a new series A exchangeable share (“Series A Qualcomm Exchangeable Security”) and 0.00698 of a new series B exchangeable share (“Series B Qualcomm Exchangeable Security”, and together with the Series A Qualcomm Exchangeable Security, the “Qualcomm Exchangeable Securities”) issued by a newly formed, wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Qualcomm (“Alternative Offer 2”). Additionally, Qualcomm and Bidco are proposing to make an offer to each holder of exchangeable shares in the capital of Alphawave Exchange Inc. (“Alphawave Exchangeable Shares”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Alphawave (the “Exchangeable Securities Offer”). Under the terms of the Exchangeable Securities Offer, if made, holders of Alphawave Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive, in exchange for each Alphawave Exchangeable Share, $2.48 in cash (the “Exchangeable Securities Cash Offer”). As an alternative to the Exchangeable Securities Cash Offer, each eligible holder of Alphawave Exchangeable Shares may elect, in respect of all (but not part) of their holding of Alphawave Exchangeable Shares, to receive, in exchange for each Alphawave Exchangeable Share, 0.00964 of a Series A Qualcomm Exchangeable Security and 0.00698 of a Series B Qualcomm Exchangeable Security (the “Exchangeable Securities Alternative Offer”). Under the terms of the Qualcomm Exchangeable Securities that may be issued in connection with Alternative Offer 2 and the Exchangeable Securities Alternative Offer, each Series A Qualcomm Exchangeable Security will be exchangeable for Qualcomm Shares on a one-for-one basis and each Series B Qualcomm Exchangeable Security will, subject to release from a four-year lock-up restriction (as further described in the Rule 2.7 Announcement), be convertible into Series A Qualcomm Exchangeable Securities that are ultimately exchangeable for Qualcomm Shares. If, subject to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition and the Exchangeable Securities Offer, (i) all eligible holders of Alphawave Shares elect for Alternative Offer 1 or Alternative Offer 2, (ii) all eligible holders of Alphawave Exchangeable Shares elect for the Exchangeable Securities Alternative Offer and (iii) all Qualcomm Exchangeable Securities are ultimately exchanged for Qualcomm Shares, an aggregate of 15,575,072 Qualcomm Shares may be issued in connection with the Acquisition and the Exchangeable Securities Offer (representing approximately 1.4% of the outstanding Qualcomm Shares at April 28, 2025, as reported in Qualcomm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2025). Such Qualcomm Shares will be issued in reliance on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on the basis of the approval of the UK High Court of Justice in England and Wales. Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding potential elections to be made by eligible holders of Alphawave Shares and Alphawave Exchangeable Shares in connection with the Acquisition and the Exchangeable Securities Offer.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to uncertainties as to the timing to complete the Acquisition; the ability to complete the Acquisition; the effect of the issuance of the Rule 2.7 Announcement and the Acquisition on Alphawave’s business relationships and employees; the ability to satisfy or waive the conditions to the Acquisition on the proposed terms and schedule, including the risk that regulatory approvals are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the parties; the ability to achieve the potential benefits of the Acquisition within the expected timeline; unknown liabilities; and other risks set forth in the Qualcomm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Qualcomm undertakes no obligation to update, or continue to provide information with respect to, any forward-looking statement or risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important Information The Acquisition relates to the shares of a company incorporated in England and Wales and is proposed to be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement under the laws of England and Wales.

The Acquisition will be made solely pursuant to the terms of the documents governing the Acquisition. The Qualcomm Shares to be issued in the Acquisition have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are expected to be issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, set forth in Section 3(a)(10) thereof on the basis of the approval of the UK High Court of Justice in England and Wales, and similar exemptions from registration under applicable state securities laws."

The Credit Agreement replaces the Company’s existing Credit Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2020, among the Company, the lenders party thereto, the letter of credit issuers party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer (the “Existing Credit Agreement”). The terms of the Credit Agreement provide for $4.0 billion in aggregate amount of commitments for senior unsecured revolving loans which will mature on August 8, 2029, unless otherwise extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides that the Company may obtain, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, loans in U.S. Dollars or alternate currencies, including Euros, Pounds Sterling and Yen. Proceeds from any borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement is unsecured and is not guaranteed by any subsidiary of the Company. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the option of the Company, at either the Term SOFR Rate (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) plus an initial margin of 0.81% per annum or the Base Rate (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) plus an initial margin of 0.00% per annum. The Credit Agreement has a facility fee, which will initially accrue at a rate of 0.065% per annum, on the actual daily amount of the aggregate commitments of the lenders in respect to the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin over the Term SOFR Rate and the Base Rate, as well as the facility fee, will fluctuate based upon the long-term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt ratings of the Company by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Negative covenants include, among others, certain limitations on the incurrence of liens by the Company and its subsidiaries and the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00, as more fully described in the Credit Agreement. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments may be terminated. At this time, the Company has not borrowed any funds under the Credit Agreement. The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. In connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated all remaining commitments of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement, which were previously scheduled to expire on December 8, 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement at the time of such termination. Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The information set forth in Item 1.01 above with respect to the Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03 insofar as it relates to the creation of a direct financial obligation of the Company."

(e) Broadcom Inc. (the “ Company ”) delivers a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions that are integral to the ongoing rapid transformation of the technological landscape, including developments in artificial intelligence (“ AI ”) and cloud computing. Under the leadership of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Hock E. Tan, the Company has developed advanced technologies that drive AI adoption, including custom AI accelerators, XPUs, network switches and other AI-related products, such as racks. The Company’s stockholders have also expressed support in securing the continued leadership of Mr. Tan to lead the Company through the unprecedented transformation of the semiconductor industry due to AI. The independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “ Board ”) believe that for the Company to compete successfully in a highly competitive technology industry that is undergoing profound change due to AI, the Company must continue to develop increasingly advanced technologies or execute on new strategies and business models to meet the accelerating demand of its customers. As a result, the independent members of the Board approved the Tan PSU Award (defined below) to incentivize Mr. Tan to extend his leadership of the Company through fiscal 2030. The independent members of the Board also consider Mr. Tan and the Tan PSU Award, which includes rigorous, challenging targets that would create value for both the Company and its stockholders and reflects feedback from its stockholders, essential to the Company’s next phase of transformative growth due to AI. Based on these considerations and in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, on September 3, 2025 (the “ Grant Date ”), the independent members of the Board granted Mr. Tan an award (the “ Tan PSU Award ”) of performance stock units (the “ PSUs ”) as part of the annual equity award program. The vesting of the PSUs under the Tan PSU Award is contingent on both (i) attainment of challenging AI-related revenue targets during a three-year performance period from the start of fiscal 2028 through the end of fiscal 2030 (the “ Performance Period ”) and (ii) continued service requirements from the Grant Date through the end of fiscal 2030 (the “ Vesting Period ”). 2023 PSU Award Holding Requirement As a condition to the grant of the Tan PSU Award, Mr. Tan has agreed to certain post-vesting holding requirements with respect to the after-tax shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ Non-Transferable Shares ”) Mr. Tan would receive at the end of fiscal 2027 upon the vesting of the PSU award previously granted to Mr. Tan on October 31, 2022 (the “ 2023 PSU Award ”). Mr. Tan has agreed to hold the Non-Transferable Shares through November 3, 2030, and if he voluntarily resigns without good reason prior to November 4, 2030, then such holding period will extend through October 31, 2032 (in each case, the “ Holding Period Expiration Date ”). During this holding period Mr. Tan has agreed not to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of (collectively, “ Transfer ”) the Non-Transferable Shares without the prior written consent of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “ Committee ”). In the event of (i) Mr. Tan’s death or permanent disability, (ii) the termination of Mr. Tan’s employment by the Company, or (iii) Mr. Tan’s termination of employment due to a resignation for good reason, the Holding Period Expiration Date will be the date of such event, as applicable. If Mr. Tan requests permission from the Committee to Transfer any Non-Transferable Shares prior to the Holding Period Expiration Date, (i) during his employment, then the Committee will provide consent to a Transfer if it determines in its discretion that, after such Transfer, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ Shares ”) held by Mr. Tan, together with the shares underlying the Tan PSU Award, is commensurate, in the Committee’s judgment, with the total number of Non-Transferable Shares or (ii) if Mr. Tan has voluntarily resigned without good reason, then the Committee will provide consent if Mr. Tan will continue to hold at least 50% of the Non-Transferable Shares after such Transfer. Incentive Opportunities of the Tan PSU Award Aligned with Stockholders The independent members of the Board designed the Tan PSU Award to deliver value to Mr. Tan only if the Company significantly increases its total revenue with respect to the Company’s AI products, including but not limited to revenue with respect to the Company’s custom AI accelerators, XPUs, ASICs, and networking and connectivity solutions (the “ AI Revenue ”), during the Performance Period. If Mr. Tan continues to provide services to the Company throughout the Vesting Period and achieves the Applicable AI Revenue (defined below) during the Performance Period, the Shares under the Tan PSU Award will vest on the last day of fiscal 2030 (the “ Final Vesting Date ”), without any interim vesting opportunities and except as otherwise set forth below. Terms of the Tan PSU Award The performance goal under the Tan PSU Award is achieved when the highest aggregate AI Revenue for a period of any four consecutive fiscal quarters within the Performance Period (the “ Applicable AI Revenue ”) is between the Achievement Levels set forth in the table below. The target number of Shares subject to the Tan PSU Award is 610,521 Shares (the “ Target PSUs ”) and the actual number of Shares earned by Mr. Tan on the Final Vesting Date (the “ Earned PSUs ”) will be the product of multiplying the Payout Percentage, as determined in accordance with the table below, by the Target PSUs. Achievement Level Payout Percentage Applicable AI Revenue Maximum 300% ≥$120 billion Stretch 200% $105 billion Target 100% $90 billion Threshold 0% ≤$60 billion If the Applicable AI Revenue is between the Achievement Levels set forth in the table above, then the Payout Percentage will be determined using a linear interpolation between these levels. If the Applicable AI Revenue is less than or equal to the Threshold Achievement Level set forth in the table above, then the Payout Percentage will be 0% and the Tan PSU Award will be forfeited in its entirety. If the Applicable AI Revenue is greater than the Maximum Achievement Level set forth in the table above, then the Payout Percentage will be 300%. As soon as administratively practicable, and in any event within 45 days, following the end of the Performance Period, the Plan Administrator will determine the Applicable AI Revenue, the corresponding Payout Percentage and the number of Earned PSUs. In the event Mr. Tan incurs a termination of employment or consultancy (a “ Termination of Services ”) during the Vesting Period, the Tan PSU Award will be forfeited in its entirety and the Shares will not be issued, except as otherwise described below: • If, during the Performance Period, Mr. Tan incurs a Termination of Services (i) by him for good reason, (ii) by the Company without cause, or (iii) due to death or permanent disability (each, a “ Covered Termination ”), a prorated portion of the Target PSUs will remain outstanding and be subject to performance-based vesting in accordance with the Tan PSU Award, with proration based on the portion of the Performance Period during which Mr. Tan provided services. • If a change in control of the Company occurs on or after the Grant Date and before the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2028, the Tan PSU Award will be forfeited in its entirety effective immediately prior to the change in control. If a change in control occurs after the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2028, the Performance Period will be shortened so that it ends on the last day of the last fiscal quarter of the Company ending immediately prior to the change in control. The number of Earned PSUs for such shortened Performance Period will be determined by multiplying (i) the prorated portion of the Target PSUs based on the portion of the Performance Period that is prior to the change in control, by (ii) the Payout Percentage. For purposes of determining the Payout Percentage for the shortened Performance Period prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2029, the Applicable AI Revenue levels included in the table above will be prorated accordingly if the change in control occurs during the second, third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2028. If a change of control occurs after the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2028, the Applicable AI Revenue levels in the table above will not be prorated. In the event of a change in control, any Earned PSUs will remain outstanding and be subject to time-based vesting in accordance with the Tan PSU Award. If Mr. Tan experiences a Covered Termination on or after the date of the change in control, such Earned PSUs will immediately vest in full. The foregoing description of the Tan PSU Award does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of award agreement applicable to the Tan PSU Award, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein."

In connection with Broadcom Inc.’s (the “Company”) entry into the Credit Agreement (as defined and discussed in more detail in Item 8.01 below), on January 13, 2025 (the “Closing Date”) the Company terminated all outstanding commitments and repaid all outstanding obligations under the credit agreement, dated as of January 19, 2021 (as previously amended, supplemented or modified, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the lenders and L/C issuers named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties from time to time party thereto. The Existing Credit Agreement originally provided for a $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement immediately prior to its termination. Absent termination, the revolving credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement would have matured in 2026. Borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bore interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, the alternate base rate or Term SOFR, in each case, plus an applicable margin that was calculated based on the Company’s credit ratings from time to time. Many of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and/or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending, hedging, cash management and/or commercial banking services, or other services in the ordinary course of business for the Company and its subsidiaries (including in connection with the transactions described in this Current Report on Form 8-K), for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and expense reimbursement. Item 8.01 Other Events. On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a credit agreement with the lenders and L/C issuers named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties from time to time party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $7.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). The proceeds of any borrowings under the Revolving Facility will be used for general corporate purposes. The Existing Credit Agreement was terminated in connection with, and as a condition to, entering into the Credit Agreement, as discussed in more detail in Item 1.02 above. The aggregate commitment of all revolving lenders under the Credit Agreement is equal to $7.5 billion, of which up to $500 million may be utilized for the issuance of multicurrency letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the aggregate amount otherwise available under the Revolving Facility for the making of revolving loans.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Earnings Press Release and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures On February 3, 2026 , the Company issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2025, and its unaudited financial position as of December 31, 2025. The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. In its press release the Company included certain non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures included in the press release are non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP operating expenses and sub-components of non-GAAP operating expenses such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses. Reconciliations for such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. The Company included Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company also included Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the year ended December 31, 2025, calculated by adding interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense to GAAP net income, and debt leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of GAAP total debt to EBITDA. The Company believes that this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity. Further, the Company believes its debt leverage ratio provides a supplemental operating metric for the full year period as it compares the amount of cash generated by our operations during the year ended December 31, 2025. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a summary of the costs and other items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate non-GAAP financial measures: • Acquisition-related expenses: Acquisition-related charges are primarily associated with assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions, including intangible assets and acquired inventory. Such charges include amortization and impairment of developed-product-technology rights, licensing rights, R&D technology rights, marketing-related rights and step-up to fair value of acquired inventory, as well as net impairment charges of in-process R&D assets. Net charges for intangible assets are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions, potential product approvals and estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, these net charges may vary in amount from period to period. The Company excludes these net charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance. The Company believes that excluding noncash net charges related to those intangible assets and inventory acquired in business acquisitions treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past and, thus, provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which these acquired assets are treated in a comparable manner to the Company's internally developed or produced assets. • Net charges pursuant to the Company’s restructuring and cost savings initiatives: Costs from restructuring and cost savings initiatives are primarily related to facilities charges, including asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, and severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to our transformation and process improvement efforts. Costs from such initiatives are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although the Company may incur these types of expenses in the future, it believes that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • Other items: The Company adjusts GAAP financial results for certain income and expenses (or gains and losses). These adjustments include: (1) gains and losses on our investments in equity securities; and (2) certain items associated with legal proceedings. The Company excludes these items for the purpose of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented because the Company believes these items are outside the ordinary course of business. The Company believes eliminating these items provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • The tax effect of the adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results take into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, the tax impact of adjustments, including the amortization of intangible assets and acquired inventory, gains and losses on our investments in equity securities and expenses related to restructuring and cost savings initiatives, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Other income tax adjustments include the impact of tax law changes. The press release also contains a discussion of the additional purposes for which the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures. This information and the information contained in the press release shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

The Company also included Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the year ended December 31, 2024, calculated by adding interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense to GAAP net income, and debt leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of GAAP total debt to EBITDA. The Company believes that this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity. Further, the Company believes its debt leverage ratio provides a supplemental operating metric for the full year period as it compares the amount of cash generated by our operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a summary of the costs and other items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate non-GAAP financial measures: • Acquisition-related expenses: Acquisition-related charges are primarily associated with assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions, including intangible assets and acquired inventory. Such charges include amortization of developed-product-technology rights, licensing rights, R&D technology rights, marketing-related rights and step-up to fair value of acquired inventory, as well as net impairment charges of in-process R&D assets. Net charges for purchased intangible assets are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions and potential product approvals as they relate to in-process R&D projects acquired. Accordingly, these net charges may vary in amount from period to period. The Company excludes these net charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance. The Company believes that excluding noncash net charges related to those intangible assets and inventory acquired in business acquisitions treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past and, thus, provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which these acquired assets are treated in a comparable manner to the Company's internally developed or produced assets. • Net charges pursuant to the Company’s restructuring and cost savings initiatives: Costs from restructuring and cost savings initiatives are primarily related to facilities charges, including asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, and severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to our transformation and process improvement efforts. Costs from such initiatives are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although the Company may incur these types of expenses in the future, it believes that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • Other items: The Company adjusts GAAP financial results for certain income and expenses (or gains and losses). These adjustments include: (1) gains and losses on our investments in equity securities; (2) certain items associated with judgments and/or settlements for legal proceedings discussed in our filings; and (3) (i) interest expense and income on senior notes issued in March 2023 and (ii) debt issuance costs and other fees related to our bridge credit agreement and term loan credit agreement, incurred prior to the closing of our acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc. The Company excludes these items for the purpose of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented because the Company believes these items are outside the ordinary course of business. The Company believes eliminating these items provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • The tax effect of the adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results take into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, the tax impact of adjustments, including the amortization of intangible assets and acquired inventory, gains and losses on our investments in equity securities and expenses related to restructuring and cost savings initiatives, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. The press release also contains a discussion of the additional purposes for which the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures.

On March 5, 2024, members of CVS Health Corporation’s (“CVS Health,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) senior management team will meet with investors and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Tom Cowhey will participate in a webcast at 9:50 a.m. (Eastern Time). During the meetings and webcast, the senior management team will reaffirm the Company’s previously announced full-year 2024 GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance of at least $7.06, its full-year 2024 Adjusted EPS guidance of at least $8.30, and its full-year 2024 cash flow from operations guidance of at least $12.0 billion. In addition, during the webcast Mr. Cowhey will provide updates on recent business trends and initiatives. An audio webcast of the presentation will be broadcast simultaneously for all interested parties through the Investor Relations portion of the CVS Health website at http://investors.cvshealth.com, and a replay of the webcast will be archived for one year. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Current Report on Form 8-K includes projected Adjusted EPS, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to analyze underlying business performance and trends. The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is projected GAAP diluted EPS. Projected GAAP diluted EPS and projected Adjusted EPS, respectively, are calculated by dividing projected net income attributable to CVS Health and projected adjusted income attributable to CVS Health, respectively, by the Company’s projected weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company defines adjusted income attributable to CVS Health as net income attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related integration costs, as well as the corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from adjusted income attributable to CVS Health. The following is a reconciliation of projected GAAP diluted EPS to projected Adjusted EPS: Year Ending December 31, 2024 At Least Per Common Share Net income attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) $ 7.06 Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 1.58 Acquisition-related integration costs (1) 0.18 Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments (2) (0.52) Adjusted income attributable to CVS Health $ 8.30 _____________________________________________ (1) Acquisition-related integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health”) and Oak Street Health, Inc. (“Oak Street Health”). (2) Represents the corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from Adjusted EPS above. The nature of each non-GAAP adjustment is evaluated to determine whether a discrete adjustment should be made to the adjusted income tax provision.

On June 29, 2025, the independent members of the Board of Directors and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of Starbucks Corporation (the “Company”, “we”, or “our”) approved a “Back to Starbucks” grant of performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) for each of the Company’s continuing named executive officers. This equity award is 100% performance based, with targets that align with each of the components of our Back to Starbucks strategy. These grants are designed to motivate and retain our senior leaders to deliver on the significant transformation required by our turnaround plan. The grants are directly tied to the achievement of key components of the Back to Starbucks plan to encourage our senior leaders to achieve these goals as quickly as possible. They include a goal of meaningfully reducing operating expenses to support continued investment in the in-store experience. We believe the success of our Back to Starbucks plan will result in the creation of significant value for our shareholders, partners (employees), and customers. The awards have a target value of $6,000,000 and will be eligible to vest following our fiscal year 2027 based on achievement of the pre-determined goals. They will pay out only if the threshold goal relating to operating expense reduction is met. The achievement of goals related to (i) the rollout of the Company’s Green Apron Service program, (ii) coffeehouse uplifts, (iii) new food and beverage platforms, and (iv) a reimagined Starbucks Rewards program can unlock payouts of up to 200% of target, subject to a downward adjustment if the Company’s relative total shareholder return compared to the S&P 500 over the performance period is not equal to or greater than the 50th percentile. Participants need to be in service through the settlement date of the PRSUs to have their PRSUs vest. The information provided herein contains forward-looking statements relating to our Back to Starbucks plan. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements and risk factor disclosures in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.

Ms. Smith holds an undergraduate degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara and an MBA from the University of Southern California. In connection with Ms. Smith’s appointment, Ms. Smith and the Company executed an offer letter on February 27, 2025 (the “Offer Letter”). Pursuant to the Offer Letter, Ms. Smith will receive an initial base salary of $925,000 per year and an annual cash incentive opportunity at a target of 125% of base salary, which will be prorated for fiscal year 2025, and is consistent with the compensation paid to our prior chief financial officer. Ms. Smith will forfeit approximately $15 million in cash incentive and equity awards in connection with her departure from her prior employer. In consideration of her forfeited cash incentive opportunity and equity awards that would have vested within the next twelve months, to induce her to join Starbucks, and consistent with Starbucks general compensation practices for executives, Ms. Smith will receive a cash signing bonus of $5,000,000. 50% of such amount will be paid on the next payroll date following the one-month anniversary of the Effective Date and the remaining 50% will be paid on the next payroll date following the twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Date, in each case, subject to Ms. Smith’s continued employment with the Company through the applicable payment date. If Ms. Smith’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or upon her death or disability, Ms. Smith will be entitled to receive any unpaid portion of the signing bonus within thirty days of her employment termination date. In consideration of her forfeited long-term cash incentive opportunity and long-term equity awards that would have vested beyond the next twelve months and to induce her to join Starbucks, Ms. Smith will also receive a replacement equity grant with a target value of $6,400,000 (the “Replacement Grant”). Further, to align Ms. Smith with Starbucks fiscal year 2025 long-term annual incentive program and in respect of her forfeited long-term cash incentive opportunity and long-term equity awards that would have vested beyond the next twelve months, Ms. Smith will receive a fiscal year 2025 annual equity award with a target value of $4,500,000 (the “2025 Annual Grant”), which amount is also consistent with the compensation paid to our prior chief financial officer. Each of the Replacement Grant and the 2025 Annual Grant will consist of 60% performance-based restricted stock units and 40% time-based restricted stock units. The vesting of each of the Replacement Grant and the 2025 Annual Grant will continue in the event Ms. Smith’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause. Ms. Smith is expected to participate in the Company’s previously disclosed Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan. Ms. Smith will also be entitled to the Company’s standard relocation benefits for senior executives and participate in employee benefit plans and programs provided by the Company to other senior executives. Ms. Smith will also be subject to the Company’s restrictive covenants agreement, which includes restrictions relating to noncompetition, non-solicitation, and protection of confidential information. The description of the Offer Letter in this Item 5.02 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Offer Letter, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. On March 4, 2025, the Company also announced that Rachel Ruggeri would no longer serve as the Company’s executive vice president, chief financial officer and principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, effective, in each case, as of a date to be determined. Ms. Ruggeri’s separation from the Company meets the conditions of the “without cause” provisions of the Company’s Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan for purposes of all plan benefits thereunder. There are no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Smith and any other person pursuant to which she was appointed as chief financial officer and designated as principal executive officer and principal accounting officer.

Effective May 7, 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into three separate revolving credit facility agreements establishing three revolving credit facilities allowing for additional borrowings of up to $14.5 billion to support the Company’s expanded commercial paper programs in connection with the anticipated financing of the Company’s pending acquisition of SRS Distribution Inc. (the “SRS Acquisition”). The agreements consist of the following: • A 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of May 7, 2024 (the “364-Day Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, establishing a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Credit Facility”). Commitments under the 364-Day Credit Facility will expire, and the 364-Day Credit Facility will mature, on May 6, 2025, unless terminated earlier; provided that the Company may elect to extend the maturity of outstanding loans (but not the commitments) for an additional one year period subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions and payment of a term out fee of 0.50% multiplied by the then outstanding loans under the 364-Day Credit Agreement. • A Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of May 7, 2024 (the “Three-Year Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, establishing a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Three-Year Credit Facility”). Commitments under the Three-Year Credit Facility will expire, and the Three-Year Credit Facility will mature, on May 7, 2027, unless terminated earlier. • A Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of May 7, 2024 (the “Capital Markets Credit Agreement”, and together with the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Three-Year Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”), among the Company, the banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, establishing a $10.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Capital Markets Credit Facility”, and together with the 364-Day Credit Facility and the Three-Year Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). Commitments under the Capital Markets Credit Facility will expire, and the Capital Markets Credit Facility will mature, on May 6, 2025, unless terminated earlier; provided that the Company may elect to extend the maturity of outstanding loans (but not the commitments) for an additional one year period subject to satisfaction certain customary conditions and payment of a term out fee of 0.50% multiplied by the then outstanding loans under the Capital Markets Credit Agreement. The Capital Markets Credit Agreement provides that the commitments under the Capital Markets Credit Facility will be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities issued in a public offering or pursuant to a Rule 144A private placement, if any, and, if the commitments as reduced exceed the outstanding loans or the commitments under the facility have been terminated, net cash proceeds from such an offering must be used to prepay outstanding borrowings under the Capital Markets Credit Facility. We currently intend to use borrowings, if any, under the Credit Facilities for general corporate purposes including to support our expanded commercial paper programs to fund the SRS Acquisition and/or, if necessary, to fund the SRS Acquisition. Fundings under the Credit Facilities are subject to conditions customary for financings of this type. Loans under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at a rate per year generally equal to, at our election, either: • At a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the interest rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in the United States; (b) 0.50% plus the greater of (i) the federal funds effective rate and (ii) the overnight bank funding rate, each as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and (c) 1.0% in excess of the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) for a one-month interest period plus 0.10%, plus the applicable margin for such loans (“Base Rate Loans”); or • Term SOFR for the selected term which may be one, three or six months, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus the applicable margin for such loans (“Term SOFR Loans”). The applicable margin for loans under the Credit Facilities will vary depending upon the Company’s ratings for senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money (the “Credit Ratings”). Based upon the Company’s current Credit Ratings, the applicable margin for Base Rate Loans would be 0.00% under all of the Credit Facilities, and the applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans would be 0.835% under the 364-Day Credit Facility and the Capital Markets Credit Facility and 0.810% under the Three-Year Credit Facility, provided that the applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans under the 364-Day Credit Facility will decrease to 0.710% and the applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans under the Three-Year Credit Facility will decrease to 0.685% once the Capital Markets Credit Facility is no longer outstanding. In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee on the commitments outstanding under each of the Credit Facilities, which also will vary depending on the 2 Company’s Credit Ratings. Based on the Company’s current Credit Ratings, the facility fee would be 0.040% under the 364-Day Credit Facility and the Capital Markets Credit Facility and 0.065% under the Three-Year Credit Facility. The Company must also pay an additional duration fee equal to 0.10% of the commitments and loans outstanding under the Capital Markets Credit Facility on each of June 28, 2024 and December 13, 2024 if the Capital Markets Credit Facility is still in effect on those dates. The Credit Agreements contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The Credit Agreements also contain a mandatory commitment termination and prepayment upon the request of the Administrative Agent (acting at the request of lenders holding a majority of commitments or loans under the relevant Credit Facility) following the occurrence of a Change of Control as defined in the respective Credit Agreements. The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreements, copies of which will be filed with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 28, 2024.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On March 27, 2024, The Home Depot, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “ Company ”), Star Acquisition Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“ Merger Sub ”), Shingle Acquisition Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ SRS ”), and Shingle Acquisition, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as the initial Holder Representative, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger Agreement ”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into SRS (the “ Merger ”), with SRS surviving the Merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will pay aggregate consideration of $18,250,000,000, subject to customary adjustments for SRS’s debt, cash, transaction expenses and net working capital (the “ Merger Consideration ”). At the effective time of the Merger (i) each share of SRS class A common stock and each share of SRS class B common stock (collectively, the “ SRS Common Stock ”, and each share, a “ SRS Common Share ”) that is issued and outstanding (other than any dissenting shares and SRS Common Shares, if any, held in treasury), will be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the estimated Merger Consideration and (ii) each option to purchase SRS Common Shares (each option, a “ SRS Option ”) that is in-the-money will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the estimated Merger Consideration less the applicable exercise price with respect to such option. Out-of-the-money options will terminate and be forfeited for no consideration. In connection with the Merger, certain members of SRS’s management team have agreed to reinvest a portion of their respective after-tax proceeds from the Merger Consideration into shares of the Company’s common stock. A portion of such shares of Company common stock will be subject to service-based vesting conditions, and all such shares will be subject to transfer restrictions of various durations. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the parties customary for a transaction of this type. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including, among others: (i) certain limitations on the conduct of business of SRS between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing date of the Merger; (ii) regulatory matters, including the parties’ efforts to consummate the closing and obtain approvals from governmental agencies; (iii) SRS’s obligation to deliver the required approval of SRS’s stockholders promptly following execution of the Merger Agreement; (iv) certain cooperation commitments by the Company with respect to the termination of SRS’s outstanding notes and SRS with respect to the Company’s transaction financing efforts; and (v) certain commitments by the Company with respect to the compensation and benefits provided to SRS employees post-closing. The parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among others: (i) the expiration of the waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) the absence of any law or governmental order prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) no material adverse effect having occurred since the signing of the Merger Agreement; (iv) receipt of SRS’s stockholder approval; and (v) certain other customary conditions relating to the parties’ representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also provides for certain customary termination rights for the parties, including: (i) by mutual written consent of the Company and SRS; (ii) by either party, if the Closing has not occurred on or before the twelve-month anniversary of the date of the Merger Agreement (the “ Initial Termination Date ”), provided, that the Initial Termination Date will automatically be extended up to two times, for a period of six months in the first extension and three months in the second extension, in each case, if only the regulatory closing conditions relating to the antitrust laws remain unsatisfied (such date, as so extended beyond the Initial Termination Date, the “ Termination Date ”); (iii) by written notice to SRS from the Company if SRS’s stockholder approval is not obtained within two business days following execution of the Merger Agreement; (iv) by either party, if any governmental authority issues an order or permanently enjoins the transaction and such order or other action becomes final and non-appealable; and (v) if the other party has breached any of its representations and warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements such that any of the conditions to closing would not be satisfied and the party has not cured any such breaches within 30 days following delivery of written notice. The Company will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $894,250,000 (i) in the event SRS or the Company terminates the Merger Agreement due to an antitrust-related governmental prohibition on the transactions or (ii) if the closing has not occurred on or before the Termination Date, as described above, and, in either case, all closing conditions (other than (a) regulatory closing conditions relating to antitrust laws or (b) conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the closing) are otherwise satisfied. The Merger Agreement will be filed to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about the Company, SRS or Merger Sub. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; are not intended as statements of fact to be relied upon by the Company’s stockholders or other security holders, but rather as a way of allocating the risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement in the event the statements therein prove to be inaccurate; have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself; may no longer be true as of a given date; and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by the Company’s stockholders or other security holders. The Company’s stockholders or other security holders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances of the Company, SRS or Merger Sub. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s public disclosures.

On May 21, 2025, Forged Fiber 37, LLC (“NetworkCo”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Inc. (“AT&T” or the “Company”), and AT&T DW Holdings, Inc. (“Guarantor”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T, entered into a definitive Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Lumen Technologies, Inc. (“Lumen”) and certain of Lumen’s indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Sellers”). The Agreement governs the acquisition by NetworkCo of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of five newly formed, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Sellers (collectively, the “Companies”). Following a series of pre-closing restructuring transactions by Lumen and the Sellers, the Companies will own substantially all of Lumen’s mass markets fiber-to-the-premises network assets and related operations in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington (the “Business”). At closing, NetworkCo will acquire the Companies from the Sellers. Purchase Price NetworkCo will pay the Sellers cash consideration of $5.75 billion, subject to adjustments for working capital and other negotiated purchase price adjustments specified in the Agreement. Closing and Conditions The transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2026, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including: • expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and receipt of other regulatory approvals, if any (the “Required Regulatory Approvals”); • absence of legal restraints or injunctions prohibiting the transaction; • accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties, subject to “Material Adverse Effect” or materiality qualifiers; • performance in all material respects of each party’s covenants; • consummation of Lumen’s internal restructuring such that the Companies hold the assets related to the Business; and • receipt by NetworkCo of a specified minimum number of public access rights in respect of the Business. Representations, Warranties and Covenants The Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding the Business, the Companies, NetworkCo and the Sellers. Each party has agreed to customary covenants, including: • operation of the Business by the Sellers in the ordinary course prior to closing; • obligations to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals and third-party consents; • restrictions on solicitation of competing transactions by the Sellers; • non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality undertakings; and • obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts and negotiate in good faith to finalize various ancillary commercial agreements. Termination The Agreement may be terminated by either the Sellers or NetworkCo under certain circumstances, including by mutual agreement of the parties, if closing has not occurred by the twelve-month anniversary of the Agreement (subject to up to two automatic three-month extensions if specified conditions are met), if a governmental order permanently restrains the transaction, or upon uncured material breach by the other party. Indemnification and Guarantee The Sellers will indemnify NetworkCo for: (i) certain excluded liabilities; (ii) liabilities arising from the pre-closing restructuring; (iii) breaches of the Sellers’ covenants surviving closing; and (iv) specified pole-attachment decommissioning costs. NetworkCo will indemnify the Sellers for: (i) certain assumed liabilities; (ii) liabilities arising from the operation of the Business post-closing; and (iii) breaches of NetworkCo’s covenants surviving closing. Subject to certain exceptions (including fraud), the Agreement does not provide for indemnification with respect to breaches of representations and warranties; NetworkCo has obtained representation and warranty insurance to provide coverage for such matters. As part of the Agreement, Guarantor has guaranteed NetworkCo’s payment and performance obligations under the Agreement to Lumen and the Sellers, subject to customary terms and conditions. Other Provisions The Agreement contains additional provisions customary for transactions of this nature, including specific performance rights, allocation of expenses and limitation on remedies. Upon consummating the transaction, NetworkCo, the Sellers and certain of their respective affiliates plan to enter into various commercial agreements designed to permit, among other things, the parties to continue to serve their respective customers.

Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as “we” or “AT&T.” AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. Overview We announced on January 27, 2025 that fourth-quarter 2024 net income attributable to common stock totaled $4.0 billion, or $0.56 per diluted share. Fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per diluted share includes amounts totaling to $0.1 billion resulting from the following significant items (per share): $0.03 of benefit from tax items, offset by net $(0.01) from a loss on actuarial remeasurement of pension and postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations and other items. The results compare with a reported net income attributable to common stock of $2.1 billion, or $0.30 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023, which included amounts totaling to $(1.7) billion resulting from the following significant items (per share): $(0.18) from a loss on actuarial remeasurement of pension and postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations, $(0.06) from restructuring and impairment charges, $(0.03) from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and $(0.01) of benefit related market-driven adjustments and other items, partially offset by $0.04 of benefit from tax items. For the full year 2024, net income attributable to common stock was $10.7 billion versus $14.2 billion in 2023. Full-year 2024 earnings per diluted share was $1.49 and included the following significant items (per share): $(0.72) from restructuring and impairment charges, $(0.09) from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and $(0.01) from a loss on actuarial remeasurement of pension and postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations, partially offset by $0.03 of benefit from tax items and $0.02 of benefit related market-driven adjustments and other items. Full-year 2023 earnings per diluted share was $1.97 and included the following significant items (per share): $(0.18) from restructuring and impairment charges, $(0.17) from a loss on actuarial remeasurement of pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, net of pension settlement gains, and obligations and $(0.14) from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, partially offset by $0.04 of benefit from tax items and $0.01 of benefit related market-driven adjustments and other items. Operating revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024 were $32.3 billion, up 0.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023, and full-year 2024 revenues were $122.3 billion, down 0.1 percent from the previous full year. The revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily due to increased Mobility and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by continued declines in Business Wireline and foreign exchange pressure in Mexico. The revenue decrease for the year reflects continued declines in Business Wireline and lower Mobility equipment revenues, partially offset by increased revenues in Mobility service and Consumer Wireline and Mexico revenues. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 were $27.0 billion, compared to $26.8 billion in the comparable 2023 period, and full-year 2024 operating expenses were $103.3 billion, compared to $99.0 billion for the previous full year. The increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter was primarily due to higher depreciation expense from accelerated depreciation on wireless network equipment associated with our Open RAN network modernization efforts, continued fiber investment and network upgrades. Operating expenses also include higher equipment costs in line with higher Mobility equipment revenues, which were offset by benefits from continued transformation, including a prior-year charge for the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment in connection with our network modernization efforts. Full-year 2024 expense increases were primarily due to a $4.4 billion noncash goodwill impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Also contributing to higher operating expenses was higher depreciation expense from accelerated depreciation on wireless network equipment associated with our network modernization efforts, continued fiber investment and network upgrades. These increases were partially offset by lower Mobility equipment costs resulting from lower wireless sales volumes and our continued transformation efforts, including lower personnel charges. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $5.3 billion compared to $5.3 billion in the comparable 2023 period, and full-year 2024 operating income was $19.0 billion compared to $23.5 billion for the full-year 2023. AT&T’s fourth-quarter operating income margin was 16.5 percent in 2024 and 2023, and full-year 2024 operating income margin was 15.6 percent compared to 19.2 percent. Other income (expense) - net in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $0.6 billion compared to $(0.9) billion in the comparable 2023 period and full-year 2024 other income (expense) - net was $2.4 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the full-year 2023. The fourth quarter increase reflects a lower actuarial loss on pension and postretirement benefits recorded in 2024 ($0.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior-year). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year write-down of investments. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments. The full-year increase reflects a lower actuarial loss on pension and postretirement benefits recorded in 2024 ($0.1 billion versus $1.6 billion in the prior-year). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year write-down of our SKY Mexico 1 equity investment. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments. Cash from operating activities for the full-year 2024 was $38.8 billion, up $0.5 billion when compared to 2023, reflecting the timing of working capital associated with device payments, as well as the expansion of committed, cost-efficient receivable sales programs and operational growth, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $20.3 billion, and when including $1.8 billion cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $22.1 billion, compared to prior-year capital investment of $23.6 billion (capital expenditures of $17.9 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $5.7 billion). Segment Summary We analyze our segments based on segment operating income, which excludes acquisition-related costs and other significant items. We also evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenues. Our reportable segments are: Communications and Latin America. Communications Our Communications segment consists of our Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. Operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $31.1 billion, up 1.1 percent versus fourth-quarter 2023, with segment operating income of $6.2 billion, down 6.3 percent versus the year-ago quarter. The Communications segment operating income margin was 19.9 percent, compared to 21.5 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Our Communications segment EBITDA margin was 36.3 percent compared to 35.8 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Mobility Mobility revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $23.1 billion, up 3.3 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by service revenue growth of 3.3 percent from subscriber and postpaid phone ARPU growth, and equipment revenue growth of 3.3 percent from higher volumes of non-phone sales and higher-priced phones sales. Mobility operating expenses totaled $17.0 billion, up 5.1 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2023 reflecting higher depreciation expense due to our Open RAN deployment and network transformation, higher equipment expenses resulting from higher sales and higher network costs, including storm impacts. Mobility’s operating income margin was 26.5 percent compared to 27.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. Our Mobility EBITDA margin was 38.4 percent compared to 37.4 percent in the year-earlier quarter. In our Mobility business unit, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we reported a net gain of 1.8 million wireless subscribers. At December 31, 2024, wireless subscribers totaled 117.9 million compared to 113.8 million at December 31, 2023. Effective with our first-quarter 2024 reporting, we have removed connected devices from our total Mobility subscribers, consistent with industry standards and our key performance metrics. Connected devices include data-centric devices such as session-based tablets, monitoring devices and primarily wholesale automobile systems. During the fourth quarter, total phone net adds (postpaid and prepaid) were 363,000, with total net adds by subscriber category as follows: • Postpaid subscriber net adds were 839,000, with phone net adds of 482,000. • Prepaid subscriber net losses were 136,000, with phone net losses of 119,000. • Reseller net adds were 1.1 million. For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, postpaid phone-only ARPU increased 0.9 percent versus the year-earlier quarter. Postpaid phone-only churn was 0.85 percent compared to 0.84 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total postpaid churn was 1.00 percent compared to 1.01 percent in the year-ago quarter. At December 31, 2024, FirstNet connections which include postpaid subscribers and connected devices, totaled 6.7 million compared to 5.5 million at December 31, 2023. Business Wireline Business Wireline revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $4.5 billion, down 10.0 percent versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower demand for legacy voice and data services as well as product simplification, partially offset by growth in connectivity services. Revenue declines also were impacted by the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to LevelBlue during the second quarter of 2024. Business Wireline operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, 2 down 2.7 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, lower customer support expenses and the contribution of our cybersecurity business. Business Wireline operating income margin was (4.6) percent compared to 3.3 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Our Business Wireline EBITDA margin was 26.3 percent compared to 30.4 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Consumer Wireline Consumer Wireline revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $3.5 billion, up 3.4 percent versus the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in broadband revenues attributable to fiber growth, partially offset by declines in legacy voice and data services and other services. Consumer Wireline operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 2.1 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher depreciation expense driven by fiber investment and higher network costs including storm impacts. These increases were partially offset by savings from cost initiatives and lower marketing expense. Consumer Wireline operating income margin was 8.0 percent compared to 6.8 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Our Consumer Wireline EBITDA margin was 35.2 percent compared to 33.1 percent in the year-earlier quarter. At December 31, 2024, Consumer Wireline had approximately 14.0 million broadband connections compared to 13.7 million at December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter, broadband subscriber net adds were 123,000, driven by growth in AT&T Internet Air; fiber broadband net adds were 307,000. Total broadband and DSL connections were 14.1 million at December 31, 2024, compared to 13.9 million at December 31, 2023. Latin America Our Latin America segment consists of our Mexico business unit and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Fourth-quarter 2024 operating revenues were $1.0 billion, down 4.2 percent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange rates, offset by higher equipment sales and subscriber growth. Operating expenses were $1.0 billion, down 9.7 percent, driven by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher equipment and selling costs attributable to subscriber growth. Mexico’s operating income margin was 2.0 percent, compared to (3.9) percent in the year-earlier quarter. Our Mexico EBITDA margin was 16.4 percent compared to 12.6 percent in the year-earlier quarter. We had approximately 23.6 million Mexico wireless subscribers at December 31, 2024 compared to 22.3 million at December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we had prepaid net adds of 490,000 and postpaid net adds of 204,000.

On April 19, 2024, AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) learned that a threat actor claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs. AT&T immediately activated its incident response process to investigate and retained external cybersecurity experts to assist. Based on its investigation, AT&T believes that threat actors unlawfully accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform and, between April 14 and April 25, 2024, exfiltrated files containing AT&T records of customer call and text interactions that occurred between approximately May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023, as described below. The data does not contain the content of calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information. Current analysis indicates that the data includes, for these periods of time, records of calls and texts of nearly all of AT&T’s wireless customers and customers of mobile virtual network operators (“MVNO”) using AT&T’s wireless network. These records identify the telephone numbers with which an AT&T or MVNO wireless number interacted during these periods, including telephone numbers of AT&T wireline customers and customers of other carriers, counts of those interactions, and aggregate call duration for a day or month. For a subset of records, one or more cell site identification number(s) are also included. While the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number. AT&T has taken additional cybersecurity measures in response to this incident including closing off the point of unlawful access. AT&T will provide notice to its current and former impacted customers. On May 9, 2024, and again on June 5, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice determined that, under Item 1.05(c) of Form 8-K, a delay in providing public disclosure was warranted. AT&T is now timely filing this report. AT&T is working with law enforcement in its efforts to arrest those involved in the incident. Based on information available to AT&T, it understands that at least one person has been apprehended. As of the date of this filing, AT&T does not believe that the data is publicly available. As of the date of this filing, this incident has not had a material impact on AT&T’s operations, and AT&T does not believe that this incident is reasonably likely to materially impact AT&T’s financial condition or results of operations.

Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as “we” or “AT&T.” AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. Overview We announced on April 24, 2024 that first-quarter 2024 net income attributable to common stock totaled $3.4 billion, or $0.47 per diluted share. First-quarter 2024 income per diluted share included amounts totaling $0.7 billion (pre-tax), or $(0.08) per share, resulting from the following significant items: $(0.06) per share from restructuring charges related to our Open RAN deployment and noncash impairment charges and $(0.03) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, partially offset by $0.01 per share of other benefit related market-driven adjustments and other items. Th ese results com pare with a reported net income attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023, which included $(0.04) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and $(0.01) per share related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, partially offset by $0.02 per share of benefit-related market-driven adjustments. Operating revenues in the first quarter of 2024 were $30.0 billion, down 0.4 percent from the first quarter of 2023, reflecting lower Mobility equipment revenue and continued declines in Business Wireline revenues. These decreases were partially offset by increased service revenues in Mobility and Consumer Wireline . Revenues also include increases resulting from f avorable impacts of foreign exchange rates in Mexico. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 were $24.2 billion, up 0.2 percent, driven by higher depreciation expense related to our continued fiber and 5G investment, and the shortening of estimated lives of network equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN deployment (our collaboration with Ericsson for commercial scale open radio access network deployment) and associated restructuring charges. These increases were largely offset by lower Mobility equipment costs resulting from lower wireless sales volumes and our continued transformation efforts. Operating income in the first quarter was $5.8 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the comparable 2023 period, and AT&T’s first-quarter operating income margin was 19.5 percent, compared to 19.9 percent in the comparable 2023 period. Other income (expense) - net in the first quarter was $0.5 billion compared to $0.9 billion in the comparable 2023 period. The decrease reflects lower pension and postretirement benefit credits in 2024, and impairments recognized on a held-for-sale business and an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business. Cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2024 was $7.5 billion, up $0.9 billion when compared to 2023, reflecting operational growth and timing of working capital, including higher receivable sales that were partially offset by higher device payments. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2024 were $3.8 billion, and when including $0.8 billion cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $4.6 billion, compared to prior-year first quarter capital investment of $6.4 billion (capital expenditures of $4.3 billion and vendor financing of $2.1 billion). Segment Summary We analyze our segments based on segment operating income, which excludes acquisition-related costs and other significant items. Our reportable segments are: Communications and Latin America. Communications Our Communications segment consists of our Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. First-quarter 2024 operating revenues were $28.9 billion, down 1.0 percent versus first-quarter 2023, with segment operating income of $6.7 billion, consistent with the year-ago quarter. T he Communications segment operating income margin was 23.4 percent, compared to 23.1 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Mobility Mobility revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $20.6 billion, up 0.1 percent versus the first quarter of 2023, driven by service revenue growth of 3.3% from subscriber and postpaid phone ARPU growth, offset by lower equipment revenues due to lower sales volumes. Mobility operating expenses totaled $14.1 billion, down 1.3 percent versus the first quarter of 2023 due to lower equipment expenses resulting from lower device sales, partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to our Open RAN deployment and network transformation. Mobility’s operating income margin was 31.4 percent compared to 30.5 percent in the year-ago quarter. In our Mobility business unit, during the first quarter of 2024, we reported a net gain of 741 thousand wireless subscribers. At March 31, 2024, wireless subscribers totaled 114.5 million (including approximately 5.9 million FirstNet connections) compared to 110.8 million at March 31, 2023. Effective with our first-quarter 2024 reporting, we have removed connected devices from our total 1 Mobility subscribers, consistent with industry standards and our key performance metrics. Connected devices include data-centric devices such as session-based tablets, monitoring devices and primarily wholesale automobile systems. During the first quarter, total phone net adds (postpaid and prepaid) were 350,000 with total net adds by subscriber category as follows: • Postpaid subscriber net adds were 389,000, with phone net adds of 349,000. • Prepaid subscriber net adds were 1,000, with phone net adds of 1,000. • Reseller net adds were 351,000. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, postpaid phone-only ARPU increased 0.9 percent versus the year-earlier quarter. Postpaid phone-only churn was 0.72 percent compared to 0.81 percent in the first quarter of 2023. Total postpaid churn was 0.89 percent compared to 0.99 percent in the year-ago quarter. Business Wireline Business Wireline revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $4.9 billion, down 7.8 percent versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower demand for legacy voice and data services as well as product simplification, partially offset by growth in connectivity services and nonrecurring equipment revenues. Business Wireline operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, down 2.1 percent when compared to the first quarter of 2023, due to lower personnel costs, and lower marketing and customer support expenses, partially offset by higher equipment costs. Business Wireline operating income margin was 1.3 percent compared to 7.1 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Consumer Wireline Consumer Wireline revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $3.4 billion, up 3.4 percent versus the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in broadband revenues attributable to fiber, partially offset by declines in legacy voice and data services and other services. Consumer Wireline operating expenses totaled $3.1 billion, down 0.3 percent versus the first quarter of 2023, largely driven by lower customer support costs that were offset by increased network-related costs and depreciation. Consumer Wireline operating income margin was 6.4 percent compared to 2.9 percent in the year-earlier quarter. At March 31, 2024, Consumer Wireline had approximately 13.8 million broadband connections compared to 13.7 million at March 31, 2023. During the first quarter, broadband subscriber net adds were 55,000, with growth in AT&T Internet Air and fiber broadband net adds of 252,000. Total broadband and DSL connections were 13.9 million at March 31, 2024, compared to 13.9 million at March 31, 2023. Latin America Our Latin America segment consists of our Mexico business unit and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues were $1.1 billion, up 20.4 percent when compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to favorable impacts of foreign exchange rates, higher equipment sales and subscriber growth. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 16.1 percent, driven by unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher equipment sales attributable to subscriber growth. Mexico’s operating income margin was 0.3 percent, compared to (3.4) percent in the year-earlier quarter. We had approximately 22.5 million Mexico wireless subscribers at March 31, 2024 compared to 21.6 million at March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we had postpaid net adds of 116,000 and prepaid net adds of 79,000.

On January 30, 2026, on its earnings call, Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company) described its earnings and cash flow expectations for 2026, which are based on significant changes to our cost structure and our strategic approach to the market. We expect that the changes we are making will provide us with the funding necessary to continue to invest in our business for long-term growth, continue to reduce our net unsecured debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, and provide us with the capacity to return approximately $55 billion of value to our stockholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases through the end of 2028. As part of this capital return plan, on January 30, 2026, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.7075 on each outstanding share of common stock payable on May 1, 2026 to stockholders of record of such stock at the close of business on April 10, 2026. This represents an annualized increase of $0.07 per share, or 2.5%, from our prior annual dividend rate. Also on January 30, 2026, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program for up to $25 billion of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate consideration paid to purchase shares of our common stock reaches $25 billion, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 or Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We expect to repurchase at least $3 billion of common stock under this authorization in 2026. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated January 30, 2026, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release and financial tables attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe provides relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, acquisition and integration related charges and legacy legal matter. Severance charges recorded during 2025 relate to separations in connection with workforce reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2025 and 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses, as part of our transformation initiatives . Acquisition and integration related charges recorded during 2025 relate to transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. completed in January 2026. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt, a fifty percent equity credit related to junior subordinated notes, and cash and cash equivalents, from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges (credits), asset and business rationalization, acquisition and integration related charges and legacy legal matter. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We exclude the acquisition and integration related charges because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the related costs to integrate an acquired business into our operations are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of acquisition and integration related charges facilitates more consistent comparisons of our operating results with historical periods, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2026. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Forecast Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP."

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as an exhibit hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated July 21, 2025, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release and financial tables attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Consolidated EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization and legacy legal matter. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses, as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and severance, pension and benefits charges. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2025. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Forecast Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP."

Mr. Vestberg’s target 2025 long term incentive opportunity increased from $18,000,000 to $25,000,000, and consistent with Mr. Vestberg's prior annual long-term incentive awards, the award is comprised of 67% performance stock units (PSUs) and 33% restricted stock units (RSUs). The PSUs and RSUs are subject to the same terms and conditions as the PSUs and RSUs granted to the other senior executives, which is consistent with prior year long-term incentive awards. Item 7.01.

Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated October 22, 2024, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy legal matter, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses, as part of our continued transformation initiatives. A sset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance charges, asset and business rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company’s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP."

Other Events Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company and, together with its subsidiaries, Verizon) expects the following items to impact its reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024: • In June 2024, Verizon announced a voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 4,800 eligible employees will separate from Verizon under this program by the end of March 2025, with over half of these employees exiting in September of 2024. Principally as a result of this program but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company expects to record a severance charge in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion ($1.3 billion to $1.4 billion after-tax) in the third quarter of 2024. • As part of its continued transformation initiatives, in September 2024, Verizon plans to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses. As a result of these strategic actions, the Company expects to record asset and business rationalization charges in the range of $230 million to $380 million ($170 million to $290 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2024.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated July 22, 2024, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated July 22, 2024, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: legacy legal matter, severance charges, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, asset rationalization, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Asset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges and asset rationalization. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company’s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges and asset rationalization. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP."

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated April 22, 2024, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated April 22, 2024, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: legacy legal matter, severance charges, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, asset rationalization, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Asset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months.

(NEE) is incorporated herein by reference. SECTION 7 – REGULATION FD Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure Members of NEE's senior management team will participate in various investor meetings throughout January 2026. They plan to discuss, among other things, that its adjusted earnings per share expectations through 2032, its long-term growth target from 2032 to 2035 and its dividend per share growth expectations for 2026, 2027 and 2028 remain unchanged. NEE continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2025 and 2026 to be between $3.62 and $3.70 and between $3.92 and $4.02, respectively, and expects compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of at least 8% annually through 2032, based on the expected 2025 adjusted earnings per share range. In addition, NEE continues to target long-term adjusted earnings per share growth of at least 8% through 2035, also based on the expected 2025 adjusted earnings per share range. NEE continues to expect dividends per share growth of approximately 10% annually through 2026, off a 2024 base and expects dividends per share growth of approximately 6% annually for 2027 and 2028, off a 2026 base. Dividend declarations are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of NEE. This Current Report on Form 8-K refers to adjusted earnings per share expectations. NEE does not provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted earnings per share to earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because certain information needed to reconcile these measures is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying these measures. These items include, but are not limited to, the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments. These items could significantly impact GAAP earnings per share. Expectations regarding adjusted earnings and dividends per share growth and other forward-looking statements assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Florida; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind, solar and storage development and construction; market demand for generation development and capacity needs; market demand and policy support for transmission development and expansion; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; rate case outcomes consistent with historical; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. NEE's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, NextEra Energy) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NextEra Energy's control. Forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K include, among others, statements concerning adjusted earnings per share expectations and future operating performance and statements concerning future dividends. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “will,” “may result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “potential,” “projection,” “forecast,” “predict,” “goals,” “target,” “outlook,” “should,” “would” or similar words or expressions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance. The future results of NextEra Energy and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, or may require it to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Form 8-K and the following: effects of extensive regulation of NextEra Energy's business operations; inability of NextEra Energy to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise; impact of political, regulatory, operational and economic factors on regulatory decisions important to NextEra Energy; effect of any reductions or modifications to, or elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support clean energy projects or the imposition of additional tax laws, tariffs, duties, policies or other costs or assessments on clean energy or equipment necessary to generate, store or deliver it; impact of new or revised laws, regulations, executive orders, interpretations or constitutional ballot and regulatory initiatives on NextEra Energy; capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities attributable to environmental laws, regulations and other standards applicable to NextEra Energy; effects on NextEra Energy of federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions; exposure of NextEra Energy to significant and increasing compliance costs and substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions as a result of extensive federal, state and local government regulation of its operations and businesses; effect on NextEra Energy of changes in tax laws, guidance or policies as well as in judgments and estimates used to determine tax-related asset and liability amounts; impact on NextEra Energy of adverse results of litigation; impacts of NextEra Energy of allegations of violations of law; effect on NextEra Energy of failure to proceed with projects under development or inability to complete the construction of (or capital improvements to) electric generation, storage, transmission and distribution facilities, natural gas and oil production and transportation facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget; impact on development and operating activities of NextEra Energy resulting from risks related to project siting, planning, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements, as well as supply chain disruptions; risks involved in the operation and maintenance of electric generation, storage, transmission and distribution facilities, natural gas and oil production and transportation facilities, and other facilities; effect on NextEra Energy of a lack of growth, slower growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage; impact on NextEra Energy of severe weather and other weather conditions; threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from geopolitical factors, terrorism, cyberattacks or other attempts to disrupt NextEra Energy's business or the businesses of third parties; inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage for protection of NextEra Energy against significant losses and risk that insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; a prolonged period of low natural gas and oil prices, disrupted production or unsuccessful drilling efforts could impact NextEra Energy’s natural gas and oil production and transportation operations and cause NextEra Energy to delay or cancel certain natural gas and oil production projects and could result in certain assets becoming impaired; risk of increased operating costs resulting from unfavorable supply costs necessary to provide full energy and capacity requirements services; inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risk within its portfolio; effect of reductions in the liquidity of energy markets on NextEra Energy's ability to manage operational risks; effectiveness of NextEra Energy's risk management tools associated with its hedging and trading procedures to protect against significant losses, including the effect of unforeseen price variances from historical behavior; impact of unavailability or disruption of power transmission or commodity transportation operations on sale and delivery of power or natural gas; exposure of NextEra Energy to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors; failure of counterparties to perform under derivative contracts or of requirement for NextEra Energy to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts; failure or breach of NextEra Energy's information technology systems; risks to NextEra Energy's retail businesses from compromise of sensitive customer data; losses from volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in over-the-counter markets;

Additionally, NEE is announcing a longer-term growth target from 2032 to 2035 and providing its dividend per share growth expectations for 2027 and 2028. NEE now expects adjusted earnings per share for 2025 and 2026 to be between $3.62 and $3.70 and between $3.92 and $4.02, respectively, and expects compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of at least 8% annually through 2032, based on the expected 2025 adjusted earnings per share range. In addition, NEE is targeting long-term adjusted earnings per share growth of at least 8% through 2035, also based on the expected 2025 adjusted earnings per share range. NEE continues to expect dividends per share growth of approximately 10% annually through 2026, off a 2024 base and expects dividends per share growth of approximately 6% annually for 2027 and 2028, off a 2026 base. Dividend declarations are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of NEE. This Current Report on Form 8-K refers to adjusted earnings per share expectations. NEE does not provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted earnings per share to earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because certain information needed to reconcile these measures is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying these measures. These items include, but are not limited to, the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments. These items could significantly impact GAAP earnings per share. Expectations regarding adjusted earnings and dividends per share growth and other forward-looking statements assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Florida; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind, solar and storage development and construction; market demand for generation development and capacity needs, market demand and policy support for transmission development and expansion; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; rate case outcomes consistent with historical; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. NEE's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors.

Key elements of the 2025 rate agreement, which will be effective from January 2026 through at least December 2029, include the following: • New retail base rates and charges would be established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues: ◦ $945 million beginning January 1, 2026; and ◦ $705 million beginning January 1, 2027. • In addition, FPL would receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2025 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with solar generation projects that enter service in 2027, 2028, and 2029 and battery storage projects that enter service in 2028 and 2029 through a Solar and Battery Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism. FPL would be required to demonstrate either a specified economic or resource/reliability need for these projects. • FPL's authorized regulatory return on common equity (regulatory ROE) would be 10.95%, with a range of 9.95% to 11.95%. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE were to fall below 9.95%, FPL could seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE were to rise above 11.95%, any party with standing could seek a review of FPL's retail base rates. • FPL's authorized regulatory capital structure would reflect a 59.6% equity ratio, consistent with prior base rate cases. • FPL would be authorized to implement a rate stabilization mechanism (RSM) over the term of the 2025 rate agreement that would be comprised of: 1) up to $1.155 billion of certain deferred tax liabilities related to repairs and mixed service costs, 2) any balance remaining related to FPL’s existing reserve amortization mechanism as of January 1, 2026, and 3) investment tax credit amortization associated with certain battery storage projects that will go into service in 2025 (collectively, the RSM reserve). Subject to certain conditions, FPL could amortize the RSM reserve over the term of the 2025 rate agreement, provided that in any year of the 2025 rate agreement FPL would be required to amortize at least enough RSM reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also could not amortize any RSM reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE. • Future storm restoration costs would continue to be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $5 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs, inclusive of the costs to replenish the storm reserve, exceed the cap, FPL could request an increase to the $5 surcharge. • If federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2025 rate agreement, FPL would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. • FPL would be permitted to implement tariffs for large load customers with new or incremental load of 50 megawatts or greater and with a load factor of at least 85%. The FPSC typically takes up to 20 days to issue a final order. Parties to the base rate proceeding who opposed the approval of the 2025 rate agreement will have the right to appeal the FPSC's decision within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. 2 Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Key elements of the proposed 2025 rate agreement, which would be effective from January 2026 through at least December 2029, include the following: • New retail base rates and charges would be established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues: ◦ $945 million beginning January 1, 2026; and ◦ $705 million beginning January 1, 2027. • In addition, FPL would receive, subject to conditions specified in the proposed 2025 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with solar generation projects that enter service in 2027, 2028, and 2029 and battery storage projects that enter service in 2028 and 2029 through a Solar and Battery Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism. FPL would be required to demonstrate either a specified economic or resource/reliability need for these projects. • FPL's authorized regulatory return on common equity (regulatory ROE) would be 10.95%, with a range of 9.95% to 11.95%. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE were to fall below 9.95%, FPL could seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE were to rise above 11.95%, any party with standing could seek a review of FPL's retail base rates. • FPL's authorized regulatory capital structure would reflect a 59.6% equity ratio, consistent with prior base rate cases. • FPL would be authorized to implement a rate stabilization mechanism (RSM) over the term of the proposed 2025 rate agreement that would be comprised of: 1) up to $1.155 billion of certain deferred tax liabilities related to repairs and mixed service costs, 2) any balance remaining related to FPL’s existing reserve amortization mechanism as of January 1, 2026, and 3) investment tax credit amortization associated with certain battery storage projects that will go into service in 2025 (collectively, the RSM reserve). Subject to certain conditions, FPL could amortize the RSM reserve over the term of the proposed 2025 rate agreement, provided that in any year of the proposed 2025 rate agreement FPL would be required to amortize at least enough RSM reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also could not amortize any RSM reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE. • In addition, FPL would recognize in base rates the customers’ share of the gains generated through the asset optimization program, previously approved by the FPSC, in the month in which the gains are generated, and 100% of any annual gains in excess of $150 million would be provided to customers through the fuel cost recovery clause. • Future storm restoration costs would continue to be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $5 for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs, inclusive of the costs to replenish the storm reserve, exceed the cap, FPL could request an increase to the $5 surcharge. • If federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed 2025 rate agreement, FPL would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. • FPL would be permitted to implement tariffs for large load customers with new or incremental load of 50 megawatts or greater and with a load factor of at least 85%. The proposed 2025 rate agreement will not become effective unless approved by the FPSC. In the August 20, 2025 filing, FPL and the participating intervenors requested that the FPSC rule on the proposed 2025 rate agreement such that new rates can be implemented by January 1, 2026. The FPSC's decision may also involve their consideration of FPL's as-filed base rate proceeding. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the proposed 2025 rate ag reement, a copy of which (excluding exhibits) is filed as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference. 2 Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) and FPL regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NextEra Energy's and FPL's control. Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning the effects of the proposed 2025 rate agreement. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “will,” “may result,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “potential,” “projection,” “forecast,” “predict,” “goals,” “target,” “outlook,” “should,” “would” or similar words or expressions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance. The future results of NextEra Energy and FPL and their business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause their actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, or may require them to limit or eliminate certain operations.

effect of inability of NextEra Energy subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NextEra Energy or of NextEra Energy's performance under guarantees of subsidiary obligations on NextEra Energy's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock; the fact that the amount and timing of dividends payable on NextEra Energy's common stock, as well as the dividend policy approved by NextEra Energy's board of directors from time to time, and changes to that policy, are within the sole discretion of NextEra Energy's board of directors and, if declared and paid, dividends may be in amounts that are less than might be expected by shareholders; XPLR Infrastructure, LP’s inability to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms could have an effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NextEra Energy’s limited partner interest in XPLR Operating Partners, LP; effects of disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets on the market price of NextEra Energy's common stock; and the ultimate severity and duration of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, and its effects on NextEra Energy’s or FPL’s businesses.

The proposed four-year rate plan consists of, among other things: (i) an increase to base annual revenue requirements of approximately $1,545 million effective January 2026; (ii) an increase to base annual revenue requirements of approximately $927 million effective January 2027; and (iii) a Solar and Battery Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism to recover, subject to FPSC review, the revenue requirements associated with the cost of building and operating an additional 1,490 megawatts (MW) of solar and 596 MW of battery storage projects in 2028 and 1,788 MW of solar and 596 MW of battery storage projects in 2029. The plan also requests a non-cash tax adjustment mechanism, which would operate in a similar manner to the non-cash depreciation reserve surplus mechanisms that were integral to FPL's prior multi-year rate settlements, as well as a storm cost recovery mechanism and a process to address potential tax law changes, which are included in the 2021 rate agreement. Under this proposed four-year rate plan, FPL commits that if its requested base rate adjustments are approved, it will not request additional general base rate increases that would be effective before January 2030. FPL's requested increases are based on a regulatory return on common equity of 11.90% and continuation of FPL's regulatory capital structure, including its longstanding equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases. Accompanying FPL's petition are the testimony and exhibits of FPL's witnesses and the FPSC's required schedules supporting the 2026 and 2027 general base rate increases and charges. Hearings on the base rate proceeding are expected during the third quarter of 2025 and a final decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.

NEE continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2024, 2025 and 2026 to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.43, $3.45 to $3.70 and $3.63 to $4.00, respectively, and now expects 2027 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.32. The adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the effects of NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains and differential membership interests-related. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Florida; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; divestitures to NextEra Energy Partners, LP; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Expected adjusted earnings amounts cannot be reconciled to expected net income because net income includes the effect of certain items which cannot be determined at this time. NEE's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors.

the fact that the amount and timing of dividends payable on NextEra Energy's common stock, as well as the dividend policy approved by NextEra Energy's board of directors from time to time, and changes to that policy, are within the sole discretion of NextEra Energy's board of directors and, if declared and paid, dividends may be in amounts that are less than might be expected by shareholders; NextEra Energy Partners, LP’s inability to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms could have an effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NextEra Energy’s limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP; effects of disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets on the market price of NextEra Energy's common stock; and the ultimate severity and duration of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, and its effects on NextEra Energy’s business.

In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated October 20, 2025 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), with Scotia Capital Inc. and TD Securities Inc., as the underwriters (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference. The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the “Base Indenture”), among Prologis, Inc.

The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriters’ discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately C$693.6 million. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of borrowings under its global lines of credit, a Canadian dollar secured mortgage loan and possibly other debt. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.600 % per annum and mature on February 15, 2032 . The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership.

In addition, on or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership’s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Item 8.01 Other Events. On January 28, 2025, the Operating Partnership priced an offering of C$750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.200% Notes due 2033 (the “Notes”). In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated January 28, 2025 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), with Scotia Capital Inc. and TD Securities Inc., as the underwriters (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference. The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the “Base Indenture”), among Prologis, Inc. (the “Parent”), the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of August 15, 2013 and the ninth supplemental indenture, dated as of November 3, 2022 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture and ninth supplemental indenture, the “Indenture”). The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriters’ discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately C$742.6 million. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of borrowings under its global lines of credit and possibly other debt. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.200 % per annum and mature on February 15, 2033 . The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership. At any time prior to November 15, 2032 (the “Par Call Date”), the Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Operating Partnership, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest (not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) and principal on the Notes to be redeemed from the redemption date to the Par Call Date using as a discount rate the sum of the Government of Canada Yield Rate plus 27.5 basis points. In addition, on or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership’s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On September 3, 2025, Steven O. Vondran, the President and Chief Executive Officer of American Tower Corporation (the “Company”) attended the Citi 2025 Global TMT Conference where he participated in a “fireside chat” and one-on-one meetings with industry analysts and investors. Mr. Vondran mentioned that one of the Company’s customers in Mexico, AT&T Comunicaciones Digitales, S. de R.L. de C.V. and related entities (collectively, “AT&T Mexico”), and the Company are engaged in a legal dispute and that AT&T Mexico, which represented approximately $300 million of tenant revenue in 2024, has been withholding tower rents since the start of 2025. The Company incurred approximately $10 million of reserves in the second quarter of 2025 related to this customer, and if AT&T Mexico continues to withhold payment, the Company would likely incur additional reserves going forward. Mr. Vondran noted that the Company has valid defenses against AT&T Mexico’s claims, is vigorously defending the full enforceability of its Master Lease Agreement with AT&T Mexico (the “MLA”) and remains confident in the terms and conditions of the MLA. The arbitration is scheduled for a hearing in August 2026. Separately, Mr. Vondran discussed the Company’s relationship with DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”), noting that DISH represents approximately 2% of the Company’s total annual property revenue and approximately 4% of the Company’s total annual U.S. & Canada property revenue, and the Company and DISH have a Master Lease Agreement that was signed in 2021 and expires in 2036.
